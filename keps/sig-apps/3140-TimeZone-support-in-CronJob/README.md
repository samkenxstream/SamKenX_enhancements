## Summary

CronJob creates Jobs based on the schedule specified by the author, but the Time
Zone used during the creation depends on where kube-controller-manager is running.
This proposal aims to extend CronJob resource with the ability for a user to
define the TimeZone when a Job should be created.

## Motivation

Not long after the [introduction of CronJob in kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/11980)
a [request was raised to support setting time zones](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/47202).
The initial [response from SIG-Apps and SIG-Architecture](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/47202#issuecomment-360820586)
at the time was that introducing such functionality would require cluster operator
to manually include TimeZone database since golang did not have one.
Starting from [golang 1.15](https://go.dev/doc/go1.15) `time/tzdata` package can
be embedded in the binary thus removing the requirement for external database.
At that time, the majority of the focus was towards [moving CronJob to GA](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/19),
so the effort to support TimeZone was again delayed. Now that we have CronJob
fully GA-ed it's time to satisfy the original request.

### Goals

- Add the field `.spec.timeZone` which allows specifying a valid TimeZone name

### Non-Goals


## Proposal

Add the field `.spec.timeZone` to the CronJob resource. The cronjob controller
will take the field into account when scheduling the next Job run. In case the
field is not specified or is empty, the controller will maintain the current
behavior, which is to rely on the time zone of the kube-controller-manager
process.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

The current mechanism, which will still be the default behavior, heavily relies
on the time zone of the kube-controller-manager process, which is hard for a
regular user to figure out. Exposing an explicit field for setting a time zone
will allow CronJob authors to simplify the user experience when creating CronJobs.

### Risks and Mitigations

- Outdated time zone in the golang might lead to wrong schedule times

This problem can be mitigated with a fresh build of kube-controller-manager with
updated golang version, but it heavily relies on the go community to keep the
time zone database up-to-date.

- Outdated time zone database on the system where kube-controller-manager is running

Cluster administrator should always ensure their systems are up-to-date.

- Malicious user can create multiple CronJobs with different time zone which can
actually trigger Jobs at the exact same time

Cluster administrators should enforce quota to ensure not that many Jobs and
CronJobs can be created per user.


## Design Details

### CronJob API

The `.spec` for a CronJob is expanded with a new `timeZone` field which allows
specifying the name of the time zone to be used, the list of valid time zones
can be found [in tz database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
Missing or empty value of the field indicates the current behavior, which relies
on the time zone of the kube-controller-manager process.

In the API code, that looks like:

```golang

type CronJobSpec struct {

    // The schedule in Cron format, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron.
    Schedule string

    // Time zone for the above schedule
    TimeZone *string

}
```

The value provided in `TimeZone` field will be validated against the embedded golang
timezone database, which will result in the `kube-apiserver` and `kube-controller-manager`
binaries growing by roughly extra 500kB.

### CronJob controller

CronJob controller will use non-nil, non-empty value from `TimeZone` field when
parsing the schedule and during scheduling the next run time. Additionally, the
time zone will be reflected in the `.status.lastSuccessfulTime` and `.status.lastScheduleTime`.
In all other cases the controller will maintain the current behavior.

### Test Plan

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

1. Add tests ensuring that case insensitive location loading is properly handled.
   See [beta requirements](#beta) for more details.
2. Add at least integration and optionally e2e covering TimeZone usage.

##### Unit tests

- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/apis/batch/validation`: `2023-01-18` - `96.0%`
- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/controller/cronjob`: `2023-01-18` - `51.7%`
- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/registry/batch/cronjob`: `2023-01-18` - `56.3%`

##### Integration tests

None.

##### e2e tests

- [CronJob should support timezone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/db4c64b1a987675fff7a234e8633f4fd01c69530/test/e2e/apps/cronjob.go#L301): https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html?sig=apps&test=should%20support%20timezone

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha

- Functionality implemented behind feature gate:
  - TimeZone field added to API (kube-apiserver)
  - CronJob controller reacting to new field (kube-controller-manager)

#### Beta

- Solve issue with case insensitive location loading:
  - Test skipped on MacOS (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109218)
  - Golang issue (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/21512)

#### GA

- Add a new condition when a cronjob controller encounters an invalid time zone.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

- Upgrades

When upgrading from a release without this feature to a release with `TimeZone`
users should not notice any change in behavior. The default value for `TimeZone`
is nil, which is equal to current behavior for backwards compatibility.

- Downgrades

When downgrading from a release with this feature, to a release without `TimeZone`
there are a few cases:
  1. If TimeZone feature gate was enabled and user specified a TimeZone, the newly
  created Jobs after downgrade will return to previous behavior, as if no TimeZone
  was ever specified.
  2. If TimeZone feature gate was enabled and user did not specify TimeZone, there
  should be no change in behavior.
  3. If TimeZone feature gate was not enabled there should be no change in behavior.

Irrespectively of the option, cluster administrator should monitor `cronjob_job_creation_skew`
which reports the skew between schedule and actual job creation.

### Version Skew Strategy

This feature has no node runtime implications.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: CronJobTimeZone
  - Components depending on the feature gate: kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No, the default behavior is maintained independently of the feature gate.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes, the feature can be disabled. The outcome of disabling will depend if the
new field was set by the user:

1. If there was no value set in `TimeZone` field there will be no change in behavior.
2. If the user set a valid `TimeZone`, the newly created Jobs will be triggered
as if the field was never set.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

The controller will start reading the new field.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

Yes, both units and integration tests for enablement, disablement and transitions.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

An upgrade flow can be vulnerable to the enable, disable, enable if you have
a lease that is acquired by a new kube-controller-manager, then an old
kube-controller-manager, then a new kube-controller-manager.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

Increased `cronjob_job_creation_skew` which tracks how much a job creation
is delayed compared to requested time slot.

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

Upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path was manually tested. No issues were found during tests.

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

No.

### Monitoring Requirements

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

There's no explicit metric for TimeZone but operator should monitor `cronjob_job_creation_skew`,
ensuring the job creation skew is not increasing.

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

- [x] Events
  - Event Reason: `UnknownTimeZone` when specified TimeZone is not correct

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

99th percentile over day for cron_job_creation_skew is <= 15s

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

- [x] Metrics
  - Metric name: `cronjob_controller_rate_limiter_use`
  - Components exposing the metric: `kube-controller-manager`
  - Metric name: `cron_job_creation_skew`
  - Components exposing the metric: `kube-controller-manager`


###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

No.

### Dependencies

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

CronJob's TimeZone support relies on external TimeZone package, if one is missing
golang's internal package will be used, instead.

- kube-controller-manager and kube-apiserver
  - Usage description:
    Both kube-controller-manager and kube-apiserver need to have `CronJobTimeZone`
    feature gate turned for this feature to fully work.
    - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      CronJob's TimeZone functionality will not work.
    - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
      Delays in creating new Jobs.

- TimeZone package
  - Usage description: CronJob's TimeZone support relies on external TimeZone package,
    if one is missing golang's internal package will be used, instead.
    - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      TimeZone functionality will not work.
    - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
      Delays in creating new Jobs.

### Scalability

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

No new API calls are expected.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

Yes, `.spec.timeZone` will be present in CronJob API.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

No new calls to cloud provider are expected.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

Yes.

- API type(s): CronJob
- Estimated increase in size: new field in CronJob spec up to 50 bytes.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

No increase it existing SLIs/SLOs is expected.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

Additional CPU and memory increase in the kube-controller-manager is negligible
since the current schedule parsing is already covering time zone specification.
We're not using it, yet.

### Troubleshooting

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

###### What are other known failure modes?

- Incorrect TimeZone
  - Detection: `UnknownTimeZone` events being reported for a CronJob.
  - Mitigations: Fix the TimeZone or suspend a CronJob.
  - Diagnostics: Logs containing `TimeZone` phrase.
  - Testing: A set of unit tests is ensuring that invalid TimeZone is properly
    handled both in the apiserver and in the controller itself, reporting to
    user the problem.
- Job creation problems
  - Detection: `cron_job_creation_skew` metric is exceeding expected 15s per day.
  - Mitigations: Disable `CronJobTimeZone` feature gate.
  - Diagnostics: Check logs from CronJob controller.
  - Testing: A set of unit tests is ensuring that invalid TimeZone is properly
    handled both in the apiserver and in the controller itself, reporting to
    user the problem.

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

If possible increase the log level for kube-controller-manager and check cronjob's
controller logs looking for warnings and errors which might point where the problem
lies.

## Implementation History

- *2022-01-14* - Initial KEP draft
- *2022-06-09* - Updated KEP for beta promotion.
- *2023-01-18* - Updated KEP for stable promotion.

## Drawbacks

Using TimeZone might be simpler for users working with a cluster in different
TimeZones, but adds additional complexity to the code and to the operator
who will need to re-calculate when an actual CronJob will be creating a Job
when `.spec.timeZone` is set.

## Alternatives

Another approach was to specify time zone as an offset to UTC, but using the
name instead seems more user friendly.

## Infrastructure Needed (Optional)

None.
