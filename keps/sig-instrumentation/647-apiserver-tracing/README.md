## Summary

This Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) proposes enhancing the API Server to allow tracing requests.  For this, it proposes using OpenTelemetry libraries, and exports in the OpenTelemetry format.

## Motivation

Along with metrics and logs, traces are a useful form of telemetry to aid with debugging incoming requests.  The API Server currently uses a poor-man's form of tracing (see [github.com/kubernetes/utils/trace](https://github.com/kubernetes/utils/tree/master/trace)), but we can make use of distributed tracing to improve the ease of use and enable easier analysis of trace data.  Trace data is structured, providing the detail necessary to debug requests, and context propagation allows plugins, such as admission webhooks, to add to API Server requests.

### Definitions

**Span**: The smallest unit of a trace.  It has a start and end time, and is attached to a single trace.
**Trace**: A collection of Spans which represents a single process.
**Trace Context**: A reference to a Trace that is designed to be propagated across component boundaries.  Sometimes referred to as the "Span Context".  It is can be thought of as a pointer to a parent span that child spans can be attached to.

### Goals

* The API Server generates and exports spans for incoming and outgoing requests.
* The API Server propagates context from incoming requests to outgoing requests.

### Non-Goals

* Tracing in kubernetes controllers
* Replace existing logging, metrics, or the events API
* Trace operations from all Kubernetes resource types in a generic manner (i.e. without manual instrumentation)
* Change metrics or logging (e.g. to support trace-metric correlation)
* Access control to tracing backends
* Add tracing to components outside kubernetes (e.g. etcd client library).

## Proposal

### User Stories

Since this feature is for diagnosing problems with the Kube-API Server, it is targeted at Cluster Operators and Cloud Vendors that manage kubernetes control-planes.

For the following use-cases, I can deploy an OpenTelemetry collector as a sidecar to the API Server.  I can use the API Server's `--opentelemetry-config-file` flag with the default URL to make the API Server send its spans to the sidecar collector.  Alternatively, I can point the API Server at an OpenTelemetry collector listening on a different port or URL if I need to.

#### Steady-State trace collection

As a cluster operator or cloud provider, I would like to collect traces for API requests to the API Server to help debug a variety of control-plane problems.  I can set the `SamplingRatePerMillion` in the configuration file to a non-zero number to have spans collected for a small fraction of requests.  Depending on the symptoms I need to debug, I can search span metadata to find a trace which displays the symptoms I am looking to debug.  Even for issues which occur non-deterministically, a low sampling rate is generally still enough to surface a representative trace over time.

#### On-Demand trace collection

As a cluster operator or cloud provider, I would like to collect a trace for a specific request to the API Server.  This will often happen when debugging a live problem.  In such cases, I don't want to change the `SamplingRatePerMillion` to collecting a high percentage of requests, which would be expensive and collect many things I don't care about.  I also don't want to restart the API Server, which may fix the problem I am trying to debug.  Instead, I can make sure the incoming request to the API Server is sampled.  The tooling to do this easily doesn't exist today, but could be added in the future.

For example, to trace a request to list nodes, with traceid=4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4737, no parent span, and sampled=true:

```bash
kubectl proxy --port=8080 &
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/nodes -H "traceparent: 00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4737-0000000000000000-01"
```

### Tracing API Requests

We will wrap the API Server's http server and http clients with [otelhttp](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/master/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp) to get spans for incoming and outgoing http requests.  This generates spans for all sampled incoming requests and propagates context with all client requests.  For incoming requests, this would go below [WithRequestInfo](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/9eb097c4b07ea59c674a69e19c1519f0d10f2fa8/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/server/config.go#L676) in the filter stack, as it must be after authentication and authorization, before the panic filter, and is closest in function to the WithRequestInfo filter.

Note that some clients of the API Server, such as webhooks, may make reentrant calls to the API Server.  To gain the full benefit of tracing, such clients should propagate context with requests back to the API Server.  One way to do this is to use the wrap the webhook's http server using otelhttp, and use the request's context when making requests to the API Server.

**Webhook Example**

Wrapping the http server, which ensures context is propagated from http headers to the requests context:
```golang
mux := http.NewServeMux()
handler := otelhttp.NewHandler(mux, "HandleAdmissionRequest")
```
Use the context from the request in reentrant requests:
```golang
ctx := req.Context()
client.CoreV1().Pods("").List(ctx, metav1.ListOptions{})
```

Note: Even though the admission controller uses the otelhttp handler wrapper, that does _not_ mean it will emit spans.  OpenTelemetry has a concept of an SDK, which manages the exporting of telemetry.  If no SDK is registered, the NoOp SDK is used, which only propagates context, and does not export spans.  In the webhook case in which no SDK is registered, the reentrant API call would appear to be a direct child of the original API call.  If the webhook registers an SDK and exports spans, there would be an additional span from the webhook between the original and reentrant API Server call.

Note: OpenTelemetry has a concept of ["Baggage"](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/baggage/api.md#baggage-api), which is akin to annotations for propagated context.  If there is any additional metadata we would like to attach, and propagate along with a request, we can do that using Baggage.

### Exporting Spans

This KEP proposes the use of the [OpenTelemetry tracing framework](https://opentelemetry.io/) to create and export spans to configured backends.

The API Server will use the [OpenTelemetry exporter format](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto), and the [OTlp exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/tree/master/exporters/otlp#opentelemetry-collector-go-exporter) which can export traces.  This format is easy to use with the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector), which allows importing and configuring exporters for trace storage backends to be done out-of-tree in addition to other useful features.

### Running the OpenTelemetry Collector

The [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) can be run as a sidecar, a daemonset, a deployment , or a combination in which the daemonset buffers telemetry and forwards to the deployment for aggregation (e.g. tail-base sampling) and routing to a telemetry backend.  To support these various setups, the API Server should be able to send traffic either to a local (on the control plane network) collector, or to a cluster service (on the cluster network).

### APIServer Configuration and EgressSelectors

The API Server controls where traffic is sent using an [EgressSelector](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/20190226-network-proxy.md), and has separate controls for `ControlPlane`, `Cluster`, and `Etcd` traffic.  As described above, we would like to support sending telemetry to a url using the `ControlPlane` egress.  To accomplish this, we will introduce a flag, `--opentelemetry-config-file`, that will point to the file that defines the opentelemetry exporter configuration.  That file will have the following format:

```golang
// +k8s:deepcopy-gen:interfaces=k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime.Object

// TracingConfiguration provides versioned configuration for tracing clients.
type TracingConfiguration struct {
  metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`

  // +optional
  // URL of the collector that's running on the control-plane node.
  // the APIServer uses the egressType ControlPlane when sending data to the collector.
  // Defaults to localhost:4317
  URL *string `json:"url,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=url"`

  // +optional
  // SamplingRatePerMillion is the number of samples to collect per million spans.
  // Defaults to 0.
  SamplingRatePerMillion *int32 `json:"samplingRatePerMillion,omitempty" protobuf:"varint,2,opt,name=samplingRatePerMillion"`
}
```

If `--opentelemetry-config-file` is not specified, the API Server will not send any spans, even if incoming requests ask for sampling.

### Controlling use of the OpenTelemetry library

As the community found in the [Metrics Stability Framework KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/1209-metrics-stability/kubernetes-control-plane-metrics-stability.md#kubernetes-control-plane-metrics-stability), having control over how the client libraries are used in kubernetes can enable maintainers to enforce policy and make broad improvements to the quality of telemetry.  To enable future improvements to tracing, we will restrict the direct use of the OpenTelemetry library within the kubernetes code base, and provide wrapped versions of functions we wish to expose in a utility library.

### Test Plan

[X] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

We will test tracing added by this feature with an integration test.  The
integration test will verify that spans exported by the apiserver match what is
expected from the request.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

This feature is upgraded or downgraded with the API Server. It is not otherwise impacted.

### Version Skew Strategy

This feature is not impacted by version skew. API Servers of different versions can each prodce traces to provide observability signals independently.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?
  - [X] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
    - Feature gate name: APIServerTracing
    - Components depending on the feature gate: kube-apiserver
  - [X] Other
    - Describe the mechanism: Use specify a file using the `--opentelemetry-config-file` API Server flag.
    - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
      plane?  Yes, it will require restarting the API Server.
    - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
      of a node? No.

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?
  No. The feature is disabled unlesss both the feature gate and `--opentelemetry-config-file` flag are set.  When the feature is enabled, it doesn't change behavior from the users' perspective; it only adds tracing telemetry based on API Server requests.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?
  Yes.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?
  It will start sending traces again.  This will happen regardless of whether it was disabled by removing the `--opentelemetry-config-file` flag, or by disabling via feature gate.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?
  [Unit tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/5426da8f69c1d5fa99814526c1878aeb99b2456e/test/integration/apiserver/tracing/tracing_test.go) exist which enable the feature gate.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

###### How can a rollout fail? Can it impact already running workloads?
  Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
   mid-rollout?
   * If APIServer tracing is rolled out with a high sampling rate, it is possible for it to have a performance impact on the api server, which can have a variety of impacts on the cluster.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

  * API Server [SLOs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability/slos) are the signals that should guide a rollback.  In particular, the [`apiserver_request_duration_seconds` and `apiserver_request_slo_duration_seconds`](apiserver_request_slo_duration_seconds) metrics would surface issues resulting in slower API Server responses.

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?
  Manually enabled the feature-gate and tracing, verified the apiserver in my cluster was reachable, and disabled the feature-gate and tracing in a dev cluster.

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?
  No.

### Monitoring Requirements

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?
  This is an operator-facing feature.  Look for traces to see if tracing is enabled.

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?
  - OpenTelemetry does not currently expose metrics about the number of traces successfully sent: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/issues/2547

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the above SLIs?
  N/A

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?
  N/A

### Dependencies

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?
  The feature itself (tracing in the API Server) does not depend on services running in the cluster.  However, like with other signals (metrics, logs), collecting traces from the API Server requires a trace collection pipeline, which will differ depending on the cluster.  The following is an example, and other OTLP-compatible collection mechanisms may be substituted for it.  The impact of outages are likely to be the same, regardless of collection pipeline.

  - [OpenTelemetry Collector (optional)]
    - Usage description: Deploy the collector as a sidecar container to the API Server, and route traces to your backend of choice.
      - Impact of its outage on the feature: Spans will continue to be collected by the kube-apiserver, but may be lost before they reach the trace backend.
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:  Spans may be lost before they reach the trace backend.


### Scalability

_For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them._

_For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions._

_For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field._

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?
  This will not add any additional API calls.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?
  This will introduce an API type for the configuration.  This is only for
  loading configuration, users cannot create these objects.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?
  Not directly.  Cloud providers could choose to send traces to their managed
  trace backends, but this requires them to set up a telemetry pipeline as
  described above.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?
  No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by [existing SLIs/SLOs]?
  It will increase API Server request latency by a negligible amount (<1 microsecond)
  for encoding and decoding the trace contex from headers, and recording spans
  in memory. Exporting spans is not in the critical path.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?
  The tracing client library has a small, in-memory cache for outgoing spans.  Based on current benchmarks, a full cache could use as much as 5 Mb of memory.

### Troubleshooting

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?
  This feature does not have a dependency on the API Server or etcd (it is built into the API Server).

###### What are other known failure modes?
  - [Trace endpoint misconfigured, or unavailable]
    - Detection: No traces processed by trace ingestion pipeline
    - Mitigations: None
    - Diagnostics: API Server logs containing: "traces exporter is disconnected from the server"
    - Testing: The feature will simply not work if misconfigured. It doesn't seem worth verifying.

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

[supported limits]: https://git.k8s.io/community//sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md
[existing SLIs/SLOs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos

## Implementation History

* [Mutating admission webhook which injects trace context](https://github.com/Monkeyanator/mutating-trace-admission-controller)
* [Instrumentation of Kubernetes components](https://github.com/Monkeyanator/kubernetes/pull/15)
* [Instrumentation of Kubernetes components for 1/24/2019 community demo](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/compare/master...dashpole:tracing)
* KEP merged as provisional on 1/8/2020, including controller tracing
* KEP scoped down to only API Server traces on 5/1/2020
* Updated PRR section 2/8/2021

## Drawbacks

Depending on the chosen sampling rate, tracing can increase CPU and memory usage by a small amount, and can also add a negligible amount of latency to API Server requests, when enabled.

## Alternatives considered

### Introducing a new EgressSelector type

Instead of a configuration file to choose between a url on the `ControlPlane` network, or a service on the `Cluster` network, we considered introducing a new `OpenTelemetry` egress type, which could be configured separately.  However, we aren't actually introducing a new destination for traffic, so it is more conventional to make use of existing egress types.  We will also likely want to add additional configuration for the OpenTelemetry client in the future.

### Other OpenTelemetry Exporters

This KEP suggests that we utilize the OpenTelemetry exporter format in all components.  Alternative options include:

1. Add configuration for many exporters in-tree by vendoring multiple "supported" exporters. These exporters are the only compatible backends for tracing in kubernetes.
  a. This places the kubernetes community in the position of curating supported tracing backends
2. Support *both* a curated set of in-tree exporters, and the collector exporter
