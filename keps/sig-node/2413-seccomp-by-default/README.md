## Summary

Enable seccomp by default for all workloads running on Kubernetes to improve the
default security of the overall system.

## Motivation

Kubernetes provides a native way to specify seccomp profiles for workloads,
which is disabled by default today. Seccomp adds a layer of security that could
help prevent CVEs or 0-days if enabled by default. If we enable seccomp by
default, we make implicitly Kubernetes more secure.

### Goals

Provide a way to enable seccomp by default for Kubernetes.

### Non-Goals

Everything else related to the feature.

## Proposal

We introduce a feature gate as well as corresponding kubelet flag that enables a
seccomp for all workloads by default. There are a few options for what should
be the default seccomp profile.

The most preferred solution is to promote the `RuntimeDefault` profile
(previously the `runtime/default` annotation) to the new default one.

Container runtimes already have their own defined default profiles, which get
referenced via the `RuntimeDefault` one. This means we now promote this profile
to the new default. Every workload created will then get the `RuntimeDefault`
(`SeccompProfileTypeRuntimeDefault`) as `SeccompProfile.type` value for the
`PodSecurityContext` as well as the `SecurityContext` for every container.

The advantages of using the `RuntimeDefault` profiles are that there is no need
for shipping an additional seccomp profile. The overall version skew handling in
conjunction with runtime versions and the kubelet is easier, because container
runtimes already support `RuntimeDefault` from the introduction of the seccomp
feature.

For alternative proposals please refer to the [Alternatives
section](#alternatives).

### User Stories

As a Kubernetes admin, I want to ensure that my cluster is secure by default
without relying on workloads opting to use seccomp.

### Risks and Mitigations

Some workloads that may be running without seccomp may break with seccomp
enabled by default. All workloads would have to be tested in a staging/test
environment to ensure there are no breakages. Seccomp could either be turned off
or custom profiles could be created for such workloads.

The configuration possibilities of container runtimes differ in conjunction with
seccomp. For example:

- **containerd**
  - can only use the internal default profile for `RuntimeDefault`
  - can use a different profile for empty (unconfined) workloads via the
    `unset_seccomp_profile` option
- **CRI-O**
  - can specify a different `RuntimeDefault` profile via the `seccomp_profile`
    option
  - can use `RuntimeDefault` for empty (unconfined) workloads via
    `seccomp_use_default_when_empty`

This can result in a behavioral change when doing cluster upgrades while runtime
administrates may have to take action if they enable the feature.

## Design Details

The feature gate `SeccompDefault` will ensure that the API graduation can be
done in the standard Kubernetes way. The implementation will be mainly a switch
from `Unconfined` to `RuntimeDefault`. This will only apply if the corresponding
kubelet configuration `SeccompDefault` or the new CLI flag `--seccomp-default`
is enabled together with the feature gate.

Documentation around the feature will be added to the [k/website seccomp
section](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/clusters/seccomp).

### Test Plan

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

There are no prerequisites required.

##### Unit tests

There will be unit tests for the feature, whereas the existing seccomp tests can
be extended to cover the new behavior if enabled.

- `pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime`: `2022-06-15` - `66.3%`

##### Integration tests

No integration tests have been added for the alpha implementation because the
feature is off by default.

For the beta graduation we will defer this section to the e2e tests.

##### e2e tests

No e2e tests have been added for the alpha implementation because the feature is
off by default.

For the beta graduation, we will add a serial e2e test which covers the kubelet
configuration.

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha

- [x] Implement the new feature gate and kubelet configuration
- [x] Ensure proper tests are in place
- [x] Update documentation to make the feature visible

#### Alpha to Beta Graduation

- [x] Enable the feature gate per default
      (the kubelet configuration value still default to `false`)
- [x] No major bugs reported in the previous cycle

#### Beta to GA Graduation

- [x] Allowing time for feedback (3 releases)
- [x] Lock the Kubelet feature gate to be locked to the default value `true`
      Note, the enablement of a feature gate doesn't mean the default
      behavior will change. No default profile will be applied unless configured.
- [x] Risks have been addressed by every common container runtime
- [x] Documenting the seccomp performance impact on k/website as well as its
      workarounds (disabling the feature completely, turning off spectre
      mitigations for certain kernel versions or updating the kernel as well as
      runc)

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

The strategy for enabling the feature should be done in multiple steps, whereas
risks and mitigations are available for each one.

1. **Feature gate enabling**:
   Enabling the feature gate at the kubelet level will not turn on the feature,
   but will make it possible by using the `SeccompDefault` kubelet configuration
   or the `--seccomp-default` CLI flag.
2. **Testing the Application**:
   Before enabling the feature on a node, ensure in a dedicated test environment
   that the application code does not trigger syscalls blocked by the
   `RuntimeDefault` profile (for [CRI-O][default-crio] or
   [containerd][default-containerd]). This can be done by:
   - _Recommended_: Analyzing the code for any executed syscalls which may be
     blocked by the default profiles. If that's the case, either craft a custom
     seccomp profile based on the default or change the application deployment
     to `Unconfined`.
   - _Recommended_: Run the application against an e2e test suite to trigger
     relevant code paths. Monitor the application hosts audit logs (via auditd
     or `/var/log/audit/audit.log`) for blocking syscalls via `type=SECCOMP`. If
     that's the case, use the same mitigation as mentioned above.
   - _Optional_: Create a custom seccomp profile based on the default and change
     their default action from `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` to `SCMP_ACT_LOG`. This means
     that the seccomp filter will have no effect on the application at all, but
     the audit logs will now indicate which syscalls may be blocked.
   - _Optional_: Use cluster additions like the [Security Profiles
     Operator][spo] for profiling the application via its log enrichment feature
     or recording a profile by using its recording feature.
3. **Deploying the modified application**:
   Based on the outcome of 2., it may be required the change the application
   deployment by either specifying `Unconfined` or a custom seccomp profile.
   This is not the case if the application works as intended with
   `RuntimeDefault`.
4. **Enable the kubelet configuration**:
   The feature is now ready to be enabled by the kubelet configuration or its
   corresponding CLI flag. This should be done on a per-node basis to reduce the
   overall risk of missing a syscall during the investigations in point 2. If
   it's possible to monitor audit logs within the cluster, then it's recommended
   to do this for eventually missed seccomp events. If the application works as
   intended then the feature can be enabled for further nodes within the
   cluster.

### Version Skew Strategy

There is no explicit version skew strategy required because the feature acts as
a toggle switch.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

_This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release._

- **How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?**

  - [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
    - Feature gate name: `SeccompDefault`
    - Components depending on the feature gate: `kubelet`
    - kubelet configuration `SeccompDefault` or CLI option `--seccomp-default`

- **Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?**

  Yes, it will change the `Unconfined` seccomp profile to `RuntimeDefault` if
  no profile is specified.

- **Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back
  the enablement)?**

  Yes, the feature can be disabled but workloads have to be restarted to apply
  the previous behavior.

- **What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?**

  It will enable the feature again but only apply the new profile to new/restarted
  workloads.

- **Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?**

  Yes, the behavior can be tested via unit tests.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

- **How can a rollout fail? Can it impact already running workloads?**

  Workloads on a node may starting to fail when (re)scheduled on the node where
  the feature is enabled. Required specific syscalls may be blocked by the
  default seccomp profile, which will cause the application to get terminated.

- **What specific metrics should inform a rollback?**

  If a workload is starting to fail because of blocked syscalls (audit logs),
  then a temporarily rollback would be appropriate in production.

- **Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?**

  If we assume that enabling the feature will cause workloads to fail, then
  there are three possible mitigations available:

  1. Disable the feature on the node (downgrade):
     permanent mitigation
  2. Run the workload as `Unconfined` (the previous default):
     re-enabling possible
  3. Create a custom seccomp profile for the application (recommended):
     re-enabling possible

- **Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs,
  fields of API types, flags, etc.?**

  No

### Monitoring Requirements

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

- **How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?**

  Operators have to check the kubelet config value for the node where the
  workload runs on. They can also run `crictl inspect` to examine the used OCI
  runtime spec and find out which profile is in use.

- **What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine
  the health of the service?**

  - A workload is exiting unexpectedly after the feature has been enabled.

    - The termination reason is a "permission denied" error.
    - The termination is reproducible.
    - Replacing `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` to `SCMP_ACT_LOG` in the default profile will
      show seccomp error messages in auditd or syslog.
    - There are no other reasons for container termination (like eviction or
      exhausting resources)

  - A workload is not behaving completely functional, for example some features
    are misbehaving but the appliction does not exit.

    - There are permission denied errors in the workload logs.
    - The behavior is reproducible.
    - Replacing `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` to `SCMP_ACT_LOG` in the default profile will
      show seccomp error messages in auditd or syslog.

- **What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the above SLIs?**

  The workload availability, functionality and health is exactly the same with
  the feature enabled. This can be done by tracking the
  `kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total` in
  [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/blob/379b60abd97be5914c0b4e292b14e75c5d3cf694/docs/pod-metrics.md#pod-metrics).

- **Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability
  of this feature?**

  None

### Dependencies

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

- **Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?**

  None

### Scalability

_For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them._

_For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions._

_For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field._

- **Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?**

  No

- **Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?**

  No

- **Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud
  provider?**

  No

- **Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of
  the existing API objects?**

  No

- **Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any
  operations covered by [existing SLIs/SLOs]?**

  No

- **Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of
  resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?**

  Enabling a seccomp profile for a workload will take more time compared to not
  applying a profile at all. There is also a very low overhead for checking the
  syscalls within the Linux Kernel.

- **Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some
  node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?**

  No

### Troubleshooting

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

- **How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?**

  It will still work as intended since it's a kubelet internal feature.

- **What are other known failure modes?**

  None

- **What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?**

  None

## Implementation History

- 2023-01-10: Updated KEP to stable
- 2022-03-15: Updated KEP to beta
- 2021-05-05: KEP promoted to implementable

## Alternatives

There are multiple alternatives to the proposed approach.

### Alternative 1: Define a new `KubernetesDefault` profile

Kubernetes ships a default seccomp profile `KubernetesDefault`
(`SeccompProfileTypeKubernetesDefault`), which is the new default
`SeccompProfile.type` value for the `PodSecurityContext` as well as the
`SecurityContext` for every container.

On startup of the kubelet, it will place the default seccomp profile JSON in a
pre-defined path on the host machine. The container runtime has to verify the
existence of this profile and apply it to the container.

We could pass the information where the default profile resides on disk via the
CRI. This way we can change the path from a kubelet perspective. If the field
is empty, then we assume that the kubelet does not support or has disabled the
feature at all. This means we fallback to the currently implemented "unconfined
when not set" behavior.

A possible starting point to defining this profile is to look at docker,
containerd and CRI-O default profiles.

The advantages of defining a `KubernetesDefault` profile are:

- The Kubernetes community / SIG Node owns the profile and is able to
  improve/change it without depending on multiple container runtimes.
- Increased transparency and a more uniform documentation around the feature.
- Users still can use the `SeccompProfileTypeRuntimeDefault` and will not
  encounter any changes to their workloads, even if they turn on the feature.

### Alternative 2: Allow admins to pick one of `KubernetesDefault`, `RuntimeDefault` or a custom profile

This is a combination of alternatives 1 and 2, which allows the highest amount
of flexibility. Users have the chance to either use the `KubernetesDefault`,
`RuntimeDefault` or configure a custom seccomp profile path directly at the
kubelet level. This also implies that the kubelet has to additionally pre-check
if the profile exists and is valid during its startup.
