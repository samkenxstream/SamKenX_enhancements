**Note:** When your KEP is complete, all of these comment blocks should be removed.

To get started with this template:

- [ ] **Pick a hosting SIG.**
  Make sure that the problem space is something the SIG is interested in taking
  up. KEPs should not be checked in without a sponsoring SIG.

- [ ] **Create an issue in kubernetes/enhancements**
  When filing an enhancement tracking issue, please make sure to complete all
  fields in that template. One of the fields asks for a link to the KEP. You
  can leave that blank until this KEP is filed, and then go back to the
  enhancement and add the link.

- [ ] **Make a copy of this template directory.**
  Copy this template into the owning SIG's directory and name it
  `NNNN-short-descriptive-title`, where `NNNN` is the issue number (with no
  leading-zero padding) assigned to your enhancement above.

- [ ] **Fill out as much of the kep.yaml file as you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Title", "Authors", "Owning-sig",
  "Status", and date-related fields.

- [ ] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Summary" and "Motivation" sections.
  These should be easy if you've preflighted the idea of the KEP with the
  appropriate SIG(s).

- [ ] **Create a PR for this KEP.**
  Assign it to people in the SIG who are sponsoring this process.

- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Avoid getting hung up on specific details and instead aim to get the goals of
  the KEP clarified and merged quickly. The best way to do this is to just
  start with the high-level sections and fill out details incrementally in
  subsequent PRs.

Just because a KEP is merged does not mean it is complete or approved. Any KEP
marked as `provisional` is a working document and subject to change. You can
denote sections that are under active debate as follows:

```
<<[UNRESOLVED optional short context or usernames ]>>
Stuff that is being argued.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

When editing KEPS, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic PRs to keep discussions
focused. If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR
with suggested changes.

One KEP corresponds to one "feature" or "enhancement" for its whole lifecycle.
You do not need a new KEP to move from beta to GA, for example. If
new details emerge that belong in the KEP, edit the KEP. Once a feature has become
"implemented", major changes should get new KEPs.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source
of this file) is [here](/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md).

**Note:** Any PRs to move a KEP to `implementable`, or significant changes once
it is marked `implementable`, must be approved by each of the KEP approvers.
If none of those approvers are still appropriate, then changes to that list
should be approved by the remaining approvers and/or the owning SIG (or
SIG Architecture for cross-cutting KEPs).

## Summary

Users are increasingly deploying Kubernetes as management solution for new
workloads (batch processing) and in new environments (edge computing). Such
workloads no longer need just RAM and CPU, but also access to specialized
hardware. With upcoming enhancements of data center interconnects, accelerators
can be installed outside of specific nodes and be connected to nodes
dynamically as needed.

This KEP introduces a new API for describing which of these new resources
a pod needs. The API supports:

- Network-attached resources. The existing [device plugin API](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/resource-management/device-plugin.md)
  is limited to hardware on a node.
- Sharing of a resource allocation between multiple containers or pods.
  The device manager API currently cannot share resources at all. It
  could be extended to share resources between containers in a single pod,
  but supporting sharing between pods would need a completely new
  API similar to the one in this KEP.
- Using a resource that is expensive to initialize multiple times
  in different pods. This is not possible at the moment.
- Custom parameters that describe resource requirements and initialization.
  Parameters are not limited to a single, linear quantity that can be counted.
  With the current Pod API, annotations have to be used to capture such
  parameters and then hacks are needed to access them from a CSI driver or
  device plugin.

Support for new hardware will be provided by hardware vendor add-ons. It will
not be necessary anymore to modify Kubernetes itself.

This KEP does not replace other means of requesting traditional resources
(RAM/CPU, volumes, extended resources). The scheduler will serve as coordinator
between the add-ons which own resources (CSI driver, resource driver) and the
resources owned and assigned by the scheduler (RAM/CPU, extended resources).

## Motivation

Originally, Kubernetes and its scheduler only tracked CPU and RAM as
resources for containers. Later, support for storage and discrete,
countable per-node extended resources was added. The kubelet device plugin
interface then made such local resources available to containers. But
for many newer devices, this approach and the Kubernetes API for
requesting these custom resources is too limited. This KEP addresses
limitations of the current approach for the following use cases:

- *Device initialization*: When starting a workload that uses
  an accelerator like an FPGA, I’d like to have the accelerator
  reconfigured or reprogrammed for the workload before the workload
  itself starts. For security reasons, workloads should not be able to
  reconfigure devices directly.

  *Limitation*: Currently, it’s impossible to specify the desired
  device properties that are required for reconfiguring devices.
  For the FPGA example, a file containing the desired configuration
  of the FPGA has to be referenced.

- *Device cleanup*: When my workload is finished, I would like to have
  a mechanism for cleanup of the device, that will ensure that device
  does not contain traces/parameters/data from previous workloads and
  appropriate power state/shutdown. For example, an FPGA might have
  to be reset because its configuration for the workload was
  confidential.

  *Limitation*: Post-stop actions are not supported.

- *Partial allocation*: When deploying a container I’d like to be able
  to use part of the shareable device inside a container and other
  containers should be able to use other free resources on the same
  device.

  *Limitation*: For example, newer generations of NVIDIA GPUs have a mode of
  operation called MIG, that allow them to be sub-divided into a set of
  mini-GPUs (called MIG devices) with varying amounts of memory and compute
  resources provided by each. From a hardware-standpoint, configuring a GPU
  into a set of MIG devices is highly-dynamic and creating a MIG device
  tailored to the resource needs of a particular application is well
  supported. However, with the current device plugin API, the only way to make
  use of this feature is to pre-partition a GPU into a set of MIG devices and
  advertise them to the kubelet in the same way a full / static GPU is
  advertised. The user must then pick from this set of pre-partitioned MIG
  devices instead of having one created for them on the fly based on their
  particular resource constraints. Without the ability to create MIG devices
  dynamically (i.e. at the time they are requested) the set of pre-defined MIG
  devices must be carefully tuned to ensure that GPU resources do not go unused
  because some of the pre-partioned devices are in low-demand.  It also puts
  the burden on the user to pick a particular MIG device type, rather than
  declaring the resource constraints more abstractly.

- *Optional allocation*: When deploying a workload I’d like to specify
  soft(optional) device requirements. If a device exists and it’s
  allocatable it will be allocated. If not - the workload will be run on
  a node without a device. GPU and crypto-offload engines are
  examples of this kind of device. If they’re not available, workloads
  can still run by falling back to using only the CPU for the same
  task.

  *Limitation*: Optional allocation is supported neither by the device
  plugins nor by current Pod resource declaration.

- *Support Over the Fabric devices*: When deploying a container, I’d
  like to utilize devices available over the Fabric (network, special
  links, etc).

  *Limitation*: The device plugin API is designed for node-local resources that
  get discovered by a plugin running on the node. Projects like
  [Akri](https://www.cncf.io/projects/akri/) have to work around that by
  reporting the same network-attached resource on all nodes that it could
  get attached to and then updating resource availability on all of those
  nodes when resources get used.

Several other limitations are addressed by
[CDI](https://github.com/container-orchestrated-devices/container-device-interface/),
a container runtime extension that this KEP is using to expose resources
inside a container.

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the KEP. What is it trying to achieve? How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

* More flexibility:
  * Arbitrary parameters for resource requests
  * Network-attached resources
  * Arbitrary, resource-specific setup and cleanup actions
  * Custom matching of resource requests with available resources,
    including handling of optional resource requests
* User-friendly API for describing resource requests
* Allow resource management cluster add-ons that can be developed and deployed
  without having to re-build or reconfigure core Kubernetes component
  and that are independent of specific container runtimes.
* Rich enough semantic so that all current device plugins could
  be implemented based on dynamic resource allocation

### Non-Goals

* Replace the device plugin API. For resources that fit into its model
  of a single, linear quantity it is a good solution. Other resources
  should use dynamic resource allocation. Both are expected to co-exist, with vendors
  choosing the API that better suits their needs on a case-by-case
  basis. Because the new API is going to be implemented independently of the
  existing device plugin support, there's little risk of breaking stable APIs.

* Extend the model that kube-scheduler has about
  resources. Instead, it will need information from the resource driver for
  each resource request to determine where a Pod using the resource
  might run. The [Representing Compute Resources in Kubernetes
  proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1666PPUs4Lz56TqKygcy6mXkNazde-vwA7q4e5H92sUc/edit#)
  had some ideas what information the scheduler might need (“supports
  overcommit”, “fractional”), but ultimately any choice regarding that
  will only work for certain kinds of resources.

* Standardize how to describe available resources. Only allocated
  resources are visible through the APIs defined below. How to
  advertise available resources is driver specific because it depends
  on the kind of resource which attributes might be relevant. Drivers
  should use and document their individual approach for this (for
  example, defining a CRD and publishing through that).

* Provide an abstraction layer for resource requests, i.e., something like a
  “I want some kind of GPU”. Users will need to know about specific
  resource drivers and which parameters they support. Portability of
  workloads could be added on top of this proposal by introducing the
  selection of a resource implementation through labels and
  standardizing those labels and the associated parameters. The
  [Resource Class
  Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qKiIVs9AMh2Ua5thhtvWqOqW0MSle_RV3lfriO1Aj6U/edit#heading=h.jzfmfdca34kj)
  included such an approach.



## Proposal

The proposal is that a resource driver handles all operations that are specific
to the resources managed by that driver. This includes operations at
the control plane level (tracking where in the cluster resources are
available, helping with pod scheduling decisions, allocating resources
when requested) as well as the node level (preparing container
startup). Such a driver can be implemented in arbitrary programming
languages as long as it supports the resource allocation protocol and
gRPC interfaces defined in this KEP. Deploying it will not depend on
reconfiguring core Kubernetes components like the scheduler.

New API objects define parameters for a resource request ("ResourceClaim" in
the API) and track the state of such a request. The pod spec gets extended to
reference one or more resource requests. A pod only gets scheduled onto a node
when all of its requests are reserved for the pod and available on the
node. This prevents scheduling a pod that then gets stuck on a node while
waiting for resources to become available.

### User Stories

#### Cluster add-on development

As a hardware vendor, I want to make my hardware available also to applications
that run in a container under Kubernetes. I want to make it easy for a cluster
administrator to configure a cluster where some nodes have this hardware.

I develop two components, one that runs as part of the Kubernetes control plane
and one that runs on each node, and package those inside container images. YAML
files describe how to deploy my software on a Kubernetes cluster that supports
dynamic resource allocation.

Documentation for administrators explains how the nodes need to be set
up. Documentation for users explains which parameters control the behavior of
my hardware and how to use it inside a container.

#### Cluster configuration

As a cluster administrator, I want to make GPUs from vendor ACME available to users
of that cluster. I prepare the nodes and deploy the vendor's components with
`kubectl create`.

I create a ResourceClass for the hardware with parameters that only I as the
administrator am allowed to choose, like for example running a command with
root privileges that does some cluster-specific initialization for each allocation:
```
apiVersion: gpu.example.com/v1
kind: GPUInit
metadata:
  name: acme-gpu-init
# DANGER! This option must not be accepted for
# user-supplied parameters. A real driver might
# not even allow it for admins. This is just
# an example to show the conceptual difference
# between ResourceClass and ResourceClaim
# parameters.
initCommand:
- /usr/local/bin/acme-gpu-init
- --cluster
- my-cluster
---
apiVersion: core.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ResourceClass
metadata:
  name: acme-gpu
driverName: gpu.example.com
parametersRef:
  apiGroup: gpu.example.com
  kind: GPUInit
  name: acme-gpu-init
```

#### Partial GPU allocation

As a user, I want to use a GPU as accelerator, but don't need exclusive access
to that GPU. Running my workload with just 2Gb of memory is sufficient. This is
supported by the ACME GPU hardware. I know that the administrator has created
an "acme-gpu" ResourceClass.

For a simple trial, I create a Pod directly where two containers share the same subset
of the GPU:
```
apiVersion: gpu.example.com/v1
kind: GPURequirements
metadata:
  name: device-consumer-gpu-parameters
memory: "2Gi"
---
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ResourceClaimTemplate
metadata:
  name: device-consumer-gpu-template
spec:
  metadata:
    # Additional annotations or labels for the
    # ResourceClaim could be specified here.
  spec:
    resourceClassName: "acme-gpu"
    parametersRef:
      apiGroup: gpu.example.com
      kind: GPURequirements
      name: device-consumer-gpu-parameters
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: device-consumer
spec:
  resourceClaims:
  - name: "gpu" # this name gets referenced below under "claims"
    template:
      resourceClaimTemplateName: device-consumer-gpu-template
  containers:
  - name: workload
    image: my-app
    command: ["/bin/program"]
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
      claims:
        - "gpu"
  - name: monitor
    image: my-app
    command: ["/bin/other-program"]
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "32Mi"
        cpu: "25m"
      limits:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "50m"
      claims:
      - "gpu"
```

This request triggers resource allocation on a node that has a GPU device with
2Gi of memory available and then the Pod runs on that node. The remaining
capacity of the GPU may be usable for other pods, with constrains like alignment
to segment sizes ensured by the resource driver.
The lifecycle of the resource
allocation is tied to the lifecycle of the Pod.

In production, a similar PodTemplateSpec in a Deployment will be used.

#### Network-attached accelerator

As a data center operator, I want to place accelerators in a separate enclosure
where they can get connected to different compute nodes through [Compute
Express Link™ (CXL™)](https://www.computeexpresslink.org/). This is more
cost-effective because not all workloads need these accelerators and more
flexible because worker nodes can be added or removed independently from
accelerators.

Jobs then compete for these accelerators by requesting them through a
ResourceClaim. The kube-scheduler ensures that all required resources for a pod
are reserved for it (CPU, RAM, and the ResourceClaim) before scheduling the pod
onto a worker node. The resource driver then dynamically attaches the
accelerator and detaches it again when the pod completes.

#### Combined setup of different hardware functions

As a 5G telco operator, I want to use the FPGA IP block, signal processor and
network interfaces provided by the [Intel FPGA
N3000](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/platforms/pac/n3000.html)
card in a Kubernetes edge cluster. Intel provides a single resource driver that
has parameters for setting up all of these hardware functions together as
needed for a data flow pipeline.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats

Scheduling is likely to be slower when many Pods request the new
resource types, both because scheduling such a Pod involves more
round-trips through the API server for ResourceClaimStatus updates and
because scheduling one Pod may affect other Pods in ways that cannot
be anticipated by the kube-scheduler. When many Pods compete for
limited resources, multiple attempts may be needed before a suitable
node is found.

The hardware that is expected to need this more flexible allocation
approach is likely to be used by pods that run for extended periods of time,
so this is not a major concern.

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
Kubernetes ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed, and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed, and by whom?

Consider including folks who also work outside the SIG or subproject.
-->

#### Feature not used

In a cluster where the feature is not used (no resource driver installed, no
pods using dynamic resource allocation) the impact is minimal, both for
performance and security. The scheduler plugin and resource controller will
return quickly without doing any work for pods.

#### Compromised node

Kubelet is intentionally limited to read-only access for all new API types
to prevent that a
compromised kubelet interferes with scheduling of pending pods, for example
by updating information normally published by the resource driver controller.
Faking such information could be used for a denial-of-service
attack against pods using those ResourceClaims, for example by overwriting
their allocation result with a node selector that matches no node. A
denial-of-service attack against the cluster and other pods is harder, but
still possible. For example, frequently updating ResourceClaims could cause new
scheduling attempts for pending pods.

Another potential attack goal is to get pods with sensitive workloads to run on
a compromised node. For pods that don't use special resources nothing changes
in that regard. Such an attack is possible for pods with extended resources
because kubelet is in control of which capacity it reports for those: it could
publish much higher values than the device plugin reported and thus attract
pods to the node that normally would run elsewhere. With dynamic resource
allocation, such an attack is still possible, but the attack code would have to
be different for each resource driver because all of them will use their own,
custom approach for reporting resource availability.

The security of those custom approaches is the responsibility of the resource
driver vendor. Solutions like Akri which establish their own control plane and
then communicate with Kubernetes through the device plugin API already need to
address this.

#### Compromised resource driver plugin

This is the result of an attack against the resource driver, either from a
container which uses a resource exposed by the driver, a compromised kubelet
which interacts with the plugin, or through a successful attack against the
node which led to root access.

The resource driver plugin only needs read access to objects described in this
KEP, so compromising it does not interfere with dynamic resource allocation for
other drivers. It may need write access for [CRDs that communicate or
coordinate resource
availability](#implementing-a-plugin-for-node-resources). This could be used to
attack scheduling involving the driver as outlined in the previous section.

A resource driver may need root access on the node to manage
hardware. Attacking the driver therefore may lead to root privilege
escalation. Ideally, driver authors should try to avoid depending on root
permissions and instead use capabilities or special permissions for the kernel
APIs that they depend on.

A resource driver may also need privileged access to remote services to manage
network-attached devices. Resource driver vendors and cluster administrators
have to consider what the effect of a compromise could be for that and how such
privileges could get revoked.

#### User permissions and quotas

Similar to generic ephemeral inline volumes, the [ephemeral resource use
case](#ephemeral-vs-persistent-resourceclaims-lifecycle) gets covered by
creating ResourceClaims on behalf of the user automatically through
kube-controller-manager. The implication is that RBAC rules that are meant to
prevent creating ResourceClaims for certain users can be circumvented, at least
for ephemeral resources. Administrators need to be aware of this caveat when
designing user restrictions.

A quota system that limits how much of the underlying resources a user may consume
needs to be supported by the resource driver. When a user has exhausted their
quota, the driver then would refuse to allocate further ResourceClaims. Such a
quota system cannot be implemented in core Kubernetes because Kubernetes has no
information about how much a certain ResourceClaim would count against the quota.

What can be limited in Kubernetes itself is the number of ResourceClaims per
namespace. For this, two new ResourceQuota resource names get added:

- `resourceclaims` limits the number of ResourceClaim objects in a namespace
  across all resource class.
- `<resource-class-name>.resourceclass.node.k8s.io/resourceclaims` limits the
  number of ResourceClaim objects for the specific resource class.


#### Usability

Aside from security implications, usability and usefulness of dynamic resource
allocation also may turn out to be insufficient. Some risks are:

- Slower pod scheduling due to the interaction with resource drivers.

- Additional complexity when describing pod requirements because
  separate objects must be created for the parameters.

- Network-attached resources may have additional constraints that are not
  captured yet (like limited number of nodes that they can be attached to).

- Cluster autoscaling will not work as expected unless the autoscaler and
  resource drivers get extended to support it.

All of these risks will have to be evaluated by gathering feedback from users
and resource driver developers.

## Design Details

### Theory of operation

In general, this new API works as described below (more details and exploration
of corner cases will follow):

* A user creates a ResourceClaim. This claim may be created by the user
  directly (the user owns the resource's lifetime) or indirectly through a pod
  (the pod owns the resource's lifetime).

* A resource driver observes the claim and allocates the underlying resource if
  it can.

* A pod references the claim in its spec.

* When a claim is meant to be allocated for a specific pod, the scheduler and
  the resource driver(s) coordinate to pick a viable node before the claim gets
  allocated.

* Once allocated, a pod which consumes the resource is scheduled to a node where
  the resource is available.

* Kubelet on that node communicates with the node-level part of the resource
  driver to present the resource to the pod.

* When the pod completes, the Kubelet on that node communicates with node-level
  part of the resource driver to clean up.

* When the claim is released (deleted), the resource driver can free the
  underlying resource.

### Components

![components](./components.png)

Several components must be implemented or modified in Kubernetes:
- The new API must be added to kube-apiserver. The ResourceQuota admission
  plugin needs to check the new quota limits when ResourceClaims get created.
- A new controller in kube-controller-manager which creates 
  ResourceClaims from ResourceClaimTemplates, similar to
  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/controller/volume/ephemeral.
  It also removes the reservation entry for a user in `claim.status.reservedFor`,
  the field that tracks who is allowed to use a claim, when that user no longer exists.
- A kube-scheduler plugin must detect Pods which reference a
  ResourceClaim (directly or through a template) and ensure that the
  resource is allocated before the Pod gets scheduled, similar to
  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller/volume/scheduling/scheduler_binder.go
- Kubelet must be extended to retrieve information from ResourceClaims
  and to call a resource kubelet plugin. That plugin returns CDI device ID(s)
  which then must be passed to the container runtime.

For a resource driver the following components are needed:
- *Resource driver controller*: a central component which handles resource allocation
  by watching ResourceClaims and updating their status once it is done with
  allocation. It may run inside the cluster or outside of it. The only
  hard requirement is that it can connect to the API server.
- *Resource kubelet plugin*: a component which cooperates with kubelet to prepare
  the usage of the resource on a node.

An utility library for resource drivers will be developed outside of Kubernetes
and does not have to be used by drivers, therefore it is not described further
in this KEP.

### State and communication

A ResourceClaim object defines what kind of resource is needed and what
the parameters for it are. It is owned by users and namespaced. Additional
parameters are provided by a cluster admin in ResourceClass objects.

The ResourceClaim spec is immutable. The ResourceClaim
status is reserved for system usage and holds the current state of the
resource. The status must not get lost, which in the past was not ruled
out. For example, status could have been stored in a separate etcd instance
with lower reliability. To recover after a loss, status was meant to be recoverable.
A [recent KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-architecture/2527-clarify-status-observations-vs-rbac)
clarified that status will always be stored reliably and can be used as
proposed in this KEP.

All relevant state of a ResourceClaim is captured inside that object
itself. For additional information that is needed only during pod scheduling, a
separate PodScheduling object gets created by the scheduler if needed.  The
PodScheduling object has the same name and namespace as the pod and the pod as
its as owner. This ownership must be checked before using a PodScheduling
object to detect stale objects that do not match a recreated pod. Such stale
objects get deleted by the garbage collector or the scheduler, depending on who
gets to it first.

Handling state and communication through objects has two advantages:
- Changes for a resource are atomic, which avoids race conditions.
- The only requirement for deployments is that the components can connect to
  the API server. Direct communication is not needed, but in some cases
  can be optionally used to improve performance.

Using a single object is an intentional simplification compared to the
PersistentVolume/PersistentVolumeClaim model for volumes where the additional
PV object was used to capture status. That model allowed operations like
pre-provisioning volumes and then having Kubernetes bind those to claims that
get created later. For resources, the resource driver can and must handle such
pre-provisioning internally. Kubernetes wouldn't know how to match
pre-provisioned resources against claims because it has no understanding about the
parameters.

The entire state of a resource can be determined by looking at its
ResourceClaim (see [API below](#api) for details), for example:

- It is **allocated** if and only if `claim.status.allocated` is non-nil and
  points to the `AllocationResult`, the struct where the resource drivers stores
  information about a successful allocation.

- It is in use if and only if `claim.status.reservedFor` contains one or
  more users.  It does not matter whether those users, usually pods, are
  currently running because that could change at any time.

- A resource is no longer needed when `claim.deletionTimestamp` is set. It must not
  be deallocated yet when it is still in use.

Some of the race conditions that need to be handled are:

- A ResourceClaim gets created and deleted again while the resource driver
  starts allocating it. Before it actually starts doing anything, the
  driver adds a finalizer. Either adding the finalizer or removing the
  ResourceClaim win. If the driver wins, it continues with allocation
  and can either complete or abort the operation when it notices the non-nil
  DeletionTimestamp. Otherwise, allocation gets aborted immediately.

  What this avoids is the situation where an allocation succeed without having
  an object where the result can be stored. The driver can also be killed at
  any time: when it restarts, the finalizer indicates that allocation may be in
  progress and has to be completed or aborted.

  However, users may still force-delete a ResourceClaim, or the entire
  cluster might get deleted. Driver implementations must store enough
  information elsewhere to detect when some allocated resource is no
  longer needed to recover from such scenarios.

- A ResourceClaim gets deleted and recreated while the resource driver is
  adding the finalizer. The driver can update the object to add the finalizer
  and then will get a conflict error, which informs the driver that it must
  work on a new instance of the claim. In general, patching a ResourceClaim
  is only acceptable when it does not lead to race conditions. To detect
  delete+recreate, the UID must be added as precondition for a patch.
  To detect also potentially conflicting other changes, ResourceVersion
  needs to be checked, too.

- In a cluster with multiple scheduler instances, two pods might get
  scheduled concurrently by different schedulers. When they reference
  the same ResourceClaim which may only get used by one pod at a time,
  only one pod can be scheduled.

  Both schedulers try to add their pod to the `claim.status.reservedFor` field, but only the
  update that reaches the API server first gets stored. The other one fails
  with a conflict error and the scheduler which issued it knows that it must
  put the pod back into the queue, waiting for the ResourceClaim to become
  usable again.

- Two pods get created which both reference the same unallocated claim with
  delayed allocation. A single scheduler could detect this special situation
  and then trigger allocation only for one of the two pods. But it is simpler
  to proceed with pod scheduling for both of them independently, which implies
  trying to select a node and allocate for it in parallel. Depending on timing,
  the resource driver will see one of the requests for allocation first and
  execute it. The other pod then either can share the same resource (if
  supported) or must wait until the first one is done with it and reallocate
  it.

- Scheduling a pod and allocating resources for it has been attempted, but one
  claim needs to be reallocated to fit the overall resource requirements. A second
  pod gets created which references the same claim that is in the process of
  being deallocated. Because that is visible in the claim status, scheduling
  of the second pod cannot proceed.

### Custom parameters

To support arbitrarily complex parameters, both ResourceClass and ResourceClaim
contain one field which references a separate object. The reference contains
API group, kind and name and thus is sufficient for generic clients to
retrieve the parameters. For ResourceClass, that object must be
cluster-scoped. For ResourceClaim, it must be in the same namespace as the
ResourceClaim and thus the Pod. Which kind of objects a resource driver accepts as parameters depends on
the driver.

This approach was chosen because then validation of the parameters can be done
with a CRD and that validation will work regardless of where the parameters
are needed.

A resource driver may support modification of the parameters while a resource
is in use ("online resizing"). It may update the ResourceClaim status to
reflect the modified state, for example by increasing the number of concurrent
users. The driver must not allow the state to be modified such
that a user of the resource no longer has access.

Parameters may get deleted before the ResourceClaim or ResourceClass that
references them. In that case, a pending resource cannot be allocated until the
parameters get recreated. An allocated resource must remain usable and
deallocating it must be possible. To support this, resource drivers must copy
all relevant information:
- For usage, the `claim.status.allocation.resourceHandle` can be hold some copied information
  because the ResourceClaim and thus this field must exist.
- For deallocation, drivers should use some other location to handle
  cases where a user force-deletes a ResourceClaim or the entire
  cluster gets removed.

### Allocation modes

Allocation of a resource happens either immediately when a ResourceClaim gets
created (“immediate allocation”) or when a Pod is getting scheduled which
needs the resource (“delayed allocation”),
depending on a flag in the ResourceClaim spec.

Immediate allocation is useful when allocating a resource is expensive (for
example, programming an FPGA) and the resource therefore is meant to be used by
multiple different Pods, either in parallel or one after the other. The
downside is that Pod resource requirements cannot be considered when choosing
where to allocate. If a resource was allocated so that it is only available on
one node and the Pod cannot run there because other resources like RAM or CPU
are exhausted on that node, then the Pod cannot run elsewhere. The same applies
to resources that are available on a certain subset of the nodes and those
nodes are busy.

Delayed allocation solves this by integrating allocation with Pod scheduling:
an attempt to schedule a Pod triggers allocation of pending resources for nodes
that the scheduler has deemed suitable. Scheduling the pod is then put on hold
until all resources are allocated. This avoids scenarios where a Pod is
permanently assigned to a node which can't fit the pod because of the pod's
other resource requirements.

### Sharing a single ResourceClaim

Pods reference resource claims in a new `pod.spec.resourceClaims` list. Each
resource in that list can then be made available to one or more containers in
that Pod. Depending on the capabilities defined in the
`claim.status.allocation` by the driver, a ResourceClaim can be used exclusively
by one pod at a time or an unlimited number of pods. Support for additional
constraints (maximum number of pods, maximum number of nodes) could be
added once there are use cases for those.

Users of a ResourceClaim don't need to be Pods. This KEP specifically supports
Pods as users and describes how kube-scheduler and kubelet will deal with Pods
that depend on a ResourceClaim, but the API and some custom resource driver
might also be useful for controllers to manage resources without using those
resources for Pods.

### Ephemeral vs. persistent ResourceClaims lifecycle

A persistent ResourceClaim has a lifecyle that is independent of any particular
pod. It gets created and deleted by the user. This is useful for resources
which are expensive to configure and that can be used multiple times by pods,
either at the same time or one after the other. Such persistent ResourceClaims
get referenced in the pod spec by name. When a PodTemplateSpec in an app
controller spec references a ResourceClaim by name, all pods created by that
controller also use that name and thus share the resources allocated for that
ResourceClaim.

But often, each Pod is meant to have exclusive access to its own ResourceClaim
instance instead. To support such ephemeral resources without having to modify
all controllers that create Pods, an entry in the new PodSpec.ResourceClaims
list can also be a reference to a ResourceClaimTemplate. When a Pod gets created, such a
template will be used to create a normal ResourceClaim with the Pod as owner
with an
[OwnerReference](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1#OwnerReference)),
and then the normal allocation of the resource takes place. Once the pod got
deleted, the Kubernetes garbage collector will also delete the
ResourceClaim.

This mechanism documents ownership and serves as a fallback for scenarios where
dynamic resource allocation gets disabled in a cluster (for example, during a
downgrade). But it alone is not sufficient: for example, the job controller
does not delete pods immediately when they have completed, which would keep
their resources allocated. Therefore the resource controller watches for pods
that have completed and releases their resource allocations.

The difference between persistent and ephemeral resources for kube-scheduler
and kubelet is that the name of the ResourceClaim needs to be determined
differently: the name of an ephemeral ResourceClaim is `<pod>-<resource name in
the pod spec>`. Ownership must be checked to detect accidental conflicts with
persistent ResourceClaims or previous incarnations of the same ephemeral
resource. This is the same approach that was chosen for [generic ephemeral
volumes](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-storage/1698-generic-ephemeral-volumes/README.md).
For a resource driver there is no difference.

Different lifecycles can be combined with different allocation modes
arbitrarily. Some combinations are more useful than others:

```
+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|           |                             allocation mode                          |
| lifecycle |             immediate              |   delayed                       |
+-----------+------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| regular   | starts the potentially             | avoids wasting resources        |

|           | as possible                        |                                 |

```

### Coordinating resource allocation through the scheduler

<<[UNRESOLVED pohly]>>
The entire scheduling section is tentative. Key opens:
- Support arbitrary combinations of user- vs. Kubernetes-managed ResourceClaims
  and immediate vs. late allocation?
  https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3064#discussion_r901948474
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>


For immediate allocation, scheduling Pods is simple because the
resource is already allocated and determines the nodes on which the
Pod may run. The downside is that pod scheduling is less flexible.

For delayed allocation, a node is selected tentatively by the scheduler
in an iterative process where the scheduler suggests some potential nodes
that fit the other resource requirements of a Pod and resource drivers
respond with information about whether they can allocate claims for those
nodes. This exchange of information happens through the `PodScheduling`
object for a Pod. The scheduler has to involve the drivers because it
doesn't know what claim parameters mean and where suitable resources are
currently available.

Once the scheduler is confident that it has enough information to select
a node that will probably work for all claims, it asks the driver(s) to
allocate their resources for that node. If that
succeeds, the Pod can get scheduled. If it fails, the scheduler must
determine whether some other node fits the requirements and if so,
request allocation again. If no node fits because some resources were
already allocated for a node and are only usable there, then those
resources must be released and then get allocated elsewhere.

This is a summary of the necessary [kube-scheduler changes](#kube-scheduler) in
pseudo-code:

```
while <pod needs to be scheduled> {
  <choose a node, considering potential availability for those resources
   which are not allocated yet and the hard constraints for those which are>
  if <no node fits the pod> {
    if <at least one resource
            is allocated and unused or reserved for the current pod,
            uses delayed allocation, and
            was not available on a node> {
      <randomly pick one of those resources and
       tell resource driver to deallocate it by setting `claim.status.deallocationRequested` and
       removing the pod from `claim.status.reservedFor` (if present there)>
    }
  } else if <all resources allocated> {
    <schedule pod onto node>
  } else if <some unallocated resource uses delayed allocation> {
    <tell resource driver to allocate for the chosen node>
  }
}
```

Randomly picking a node without knowing anything about the resource driver may
or may not succeed. To narrow the choice of suitable nodes for all claims using
a certain resource class, a node selector can be specified in that class. That
selector is static and typically will use labels that determine which nodes may
have resources available.

To gather information about the current state of resource availability and to
trigger allocation of a claim, the scheduler creates one PodScheduling object
for each pod that uses claims. That object is owned by the pod and
will either get deleted by the scheduler when it is done with pod scheduling or
through the garbage collector. In the PodScheduling object, the scheduler posts
the list of all potential nodes that it was left with after considering all
other pod constraints and requirements. Resource drivers involved in the
scheduling of the pod respond by adding which of these nodes currently don't
have sufficient resources available. The next scheduling attempt is then more
likely to pick a node for which allocation succeeds.

This scheduling information is optional and does not have to be in sync with
the current ResourceClaim state, therefore it is okay to store it
separately.

Allowing the scheduler to trigger allocation in parallel to asking for more
information was chosen because for pods with a single resource claim, the cost
of guessing wrong is low: the driver just needs to inform the scheduler to try
again and provide the additional information.

Additional heuristics are possible without changing the proposed API. For
example, the scheduler might ask for information and wait a while before
making a choice. This may be more suitable for pods using many different
resource claims because for those, allocation may succeed for some claims and
fail for others, which then may need to go through the recovery flow with
deallocating one or more claims.

### Resource allocation and usage flow

The following steps shows how resource allocation works for a resource that
gets defined in a ResourceClaimTemplate and referenced by a Pod. Several of these steps may fail without changing
the system state. They then must be retried until they succeed or something
else changes in the system, like for example deleting objects.

* **user** creates Pod with reference to ResourceClaimTemplate
* **resource claim controller** checks ResourceClaimTemplate and ResourceClass,
  then creates ResourceClaim with Pod as owner
* if *immediate allocation*:
  * **resource driver** adds finalizer to claim to prevent deletion -> allocation in progress
  * **resource driver** finishes allocation, sets `claim.status.allocation` -> claim ready for use by any pod
* if *pod is pending*:
  * **scheduler** filters nodes based on built-in resources and the filter callback of plugins,
    which includes constraints imposed by already allocated resources
  * if *delayed allocation and resource not allocated yet*:
    * if *at least one node fits pod*:
      * **scheduler** creates or updates a `PodScheduling` object with `podScheduling.spec.potentialNodes=<nodes that fit the pod>`
      * if *exactly one claim is pending (see below)* or *all drivers have provided information*:
        * **scheduler** picks one node, sets `podScheduling.spec.selectedNode=<the chosen node>`
        * if *resource is available for this selected node*:
          * **resource driver** adds finalizer to claim to prevent deletion -> allocation in progress
          * **resource driver** finishes allocation, sets `claim.status.allocation` and the
            pod in `claim.status.reservedFor` -> claim ready for use and reserved for the pod
        * else *scheduler needs to know that it must avoid this and possibly other nodes*:
          * **resource driver** sets `podScheduling.status.claims[name=name of claim in pod].unsuitableNodes`
    * else *pod cannot be scheduled*:
      * **scheduler** may trigger deallocation of some claim with delayed allocation by setting `claim.status.deallocationRequested` to true
      (see [pseudo-code above](#coordinating-resource-allocation-through-the-scheduler)) or wait
  * if *pod not listed in `claim.status.reservedFor` yet* (can occur for immediate allocation):
    * **scheduler** adds it to `claim.status.reservedFor`
  * if *resource allocated and reserved*:
    * **scheduler** sets node in Pod spec -> Pod ready to run
    * **scheduler** deletes `PodScheduling` object if one exists
* if *node is set for pod*:
  * if `resource not reserved for pod` (user might have set the node field):
    * **kubelet** refuses to start the pod -> permanent failure
  * else `pod may run`:
    * **kubelet** asks driver to prepare the resource
  * if `resource is prepared`:
    * **kubelet** creates container(s) which reference(s) the resource through CDI -> Pod is running
* if *pod has terminated* and *pod deleted*:
  * **kubelet** asks driver to unprepare the resource
  * **kubelet** allows pod deletion to complete by clearing the `GracePeriod`
* if *pod removed*:
  * **garbage collector** deletes ResourceClaim -> adds `claim.deletionTimestamp` because of finalizer
* if *ResourceClaim has `claim.deletionTimestamp` and `claim.status.reservedFor` is empty*:
  * **resource driver** deallocates resource
  * **resource driver** clears finalizer and `claim.status.allocation`
  * **API server** removes ResourceClaim

When exactly one claim is pending, it is safe to trigger the allocation: if the
node is suitable, the allocation will succeed and the pod can get scheduled
without further delays. If the node is not suitable, allocation fails and the
next attempt can do better because it has more information. The same should not
be done when there are multiple claims because allocation might succeed for
some, but not all of them, which would force the scheduler to recover by asking
for deallocation. It's better to wait for information in this case.

The flow is similar for a ResourceClaim that gets created as a stand-alone
object by the user. In that case, the Pod reference that ResourceClaim by
name. The ResourceClaim does not get deleted at the end and can be reused by
another Pod and/or used by multiple different Pods at the same time (if
supported by the driver). The resource remains allocated as long as the
ResourceClaim doesn't get deleted by the user.

If a Pod references multiple claims managed by the same driver, then the driver
can combine updating `podScheduling.claims[*].unsuitableNodes` for all of them, after considering all
claims.

### API

The PodSpec gets extended. To minimize the changes in core/v1, all new types
get defined in a new resource group. This makes it possible to revise those
more experimental parts of the API in the future. The new fields in the
PodSpec are gated by the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate and can only be
set when it is enabled. Initially, they are declared as alpha. Even though they
are alpha, changes to their schema are discouraged and would have to be done by
using new field names.

ResourceClaim, ResourceClass and ResourceClaimTemplate are new built-in types
in `resource.k8s.io/v1alpha1`. This alpha group must be explicitly enabled in
the apiserver's runtime configuration. Using builtin types was chosen instead
of using CRDs because core Kubernetes components must interact with the new
objects and installation of CRDs as part of cluster creation is an unsolved
problem.

Secrets are not part of this API: if a resource driver needs secrets, for
example to access its own backplane, then it can define custom parameters for
those secrets and retrieve them directly from the apiserver. This works because
drivers are expected to be written for Kubernetes.

#### resource.k8s.io

```
// ResourceClass is used by administrators to influence how resources
// are allocated.
//
// This is an alpha type and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation
// feature gate.
type ResourceClass struct {
	metav1.TypeMeta
	// Standard object metadata
	// +optional
	metav1.ObjectMeta

	// DriverName defines the name of the dynamic resource driver that is
	// used for allocation of a ResourceClaim that uses this class.
	//
	// Resource drivers have a unique name in forward domain order
	// (acme.example.com).
	DriverName string

	// ParametersRef references an arbitrary separate object that may hold
	// parameters that will be used by the driver when allocating a
	// resource that uses this class. A dynamic resource driver can
	// distinguish between parameters stored here and and those stored in
	// ResourceClaimSpec.
	// +optional
	ParametersRef *ResourceClassParametersReference

	// Only nodes matching the selector will be considered by the scheduler
	// when trying to find a Node that fits a Pod when that Pod uses
	// a ResourceClaim that has not been allocated yet.
	//
	// Setting this field is optional. If null, all nodes are candidates.
	// +optional
	SuitableNodes *core.NodeSelector
}
```

A copy of the driver name is necessary to enable usage
of the claim by the kubelet in case the ResourceClass gets
removed in the meantime. It also helps the resource driver
to determine whether it needs to handle a claim that got
marked for deletion.

```
// ResourceClaim describes which resources are needed by a resource consumer.
// Its status tracks whether the resource has been allocated and what the
// resulting attributes are.
//
// This is an alpha type and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation
// feature gate.
type ResourceClaim struct {
	metav1.TypeMeta
	// Standard object metadata
	// +optional
	metav1.ObjectMeta

	// Spec describes the desired attributes of a resource that then needs
	// to be allocated. It can only be set once when creating the
	// ResourceClaim.
	Spec ResourceClaimSpec

	// Status describes whether the resource is available and with which
	// attributes.
	// +optional
	Status ResourceClaimStatus
}
```

The driver must set a finalizer in a ResourceClaim before it attempts to allocate
the resource. It removes the finalizer when a) the allocation
attempt has definitely failed or b) the allocated resource was
deallocated. This helps to ensure that resources are not leaked
during normal operation of the cluster.

It cannot prevent force-deleting a ResourceClaim by clearing its
finalizers (something that users should never do without being aware
of the consequences) or help when the entire cluster gets deleted.

```
// ResourceClaimSpec defines how a resource is to be allocated.
type ResourceClaimSpec struct {
	// ResourceClassName references the driver and additional parameters
	// via the name of a ResourceClass that was created as part of the
	// driver deployment.
	ResourceClassName string

	// ParametersRef references a separate object with arbitrary parameters
	// that will be used by the driver when allocating a resource for the
	// claim.
	//
	// The object must be in the same namespace as the ResourceClaim.

	ParametersRef *ResourceClaimParametersReference

	// Allocation can start immediately or when a Pod wants to use the
	// resource. "WaitForFirstConsumer" is the default.
	// +optional
	AllocationMode AllocationMode
}

// AllocationMode describes whether a ResourceClaim gets allocated immediately
// when it gets created (AllocationModeImmediate) or whether allocation is
// delayed until it is needed for a Pod
// (AllocationModeWaitForFirstConsumer). Other modes might get added in the
// future.
type AllocationMode string

const (
	// When a ResourceClaim has AllocationModeWaitForFirstConsumer, allocation is
	// delayed until a Pod gets scheduled that needs the ResourceClaim. The
	// scheduler will consider all resource requirements of that Pod and
	// trigger allocation for a node that fits the Pod.
	AllocationModeWaitForFirstConsumer AllocationMode = "WaitForFirstConsumer"

	// When a ResourceClaim has AllocationModeImmediate, allocation starts
	// as soon as the ResourceClaim gets created. This is done without
	// considering the needs of Pods that will use the ResourceClaim
	// because those Pods are not known yet.
	AllocationModeImmediate AllocationMode = "Immediate"
)

// ResourceClaimStatus tracks whether the resource has been allocated and what
// the resulting attributes are.
type ResourceClaimStatus struct {
	// DriverName is a copy of the driver name from the ResourceClass at
	// the time when allocation started.
	// +optional
	DriverName string

	// Allocation is set by the resource driver once a resource has been
	// allocated successfully. If this is not specified, the resource is
	// not yet allocated.
	// +optional
	Allocation *AllocationResult

	// ReservedFor indicates which entities are currently allowed to use
	// the claim. A Pod which references a ResourceClaim which is not
	// reserved for that Pod will not be started.
	//
	// There can be at most 32 such reservations. This may get increased in
	// the future, but not reduced.
	// +optional
	ReservedFor []ResourceClaimConsumerReference

	// DeallocationRequested indicates that a ResourceClaim is to be
	// deallocated.
	//
	// The driver then must deallocate this claim and reset the field

	// ReservedFor.
	// +optional
	DeallocationRequested bool
}

// ReservedForMaxSize is the maximum number of entries in
// claim.status.reservedFor.
const ResourceClaimReservedForMaxSize = 32
```

DeallocationRequested gets set by the scheduler when it detects
that pod scheduling cannot proceed because some
claim was allocated for a node for which some other pending claims
cannot be allocated because that node ran out of resources for those.

```
// AllocationResult contains attributed of an allocated resource.
type AllocationResult struct {
	// ResourceHandle contains arbitrary data returned by the driver after a

	// +optional
	ResourceHandle string

	// This field will get set by the resource driver after it has
	// allocated the resource driver to inform the scheduler where it can
	// schedule Pods using the ResourceClaim.
	//
	// Setting this field is optional. If null, the resource is available
	// everywhere.
	// +optional
	AvailableOnNodes *core.NodeSelector

	// Shareable determines whether the resource supports more
	// than one consumer at a time.

	<<[UNRESOLVED pohly]>>
	We will have to discuss use cases and real resource drivers that
	support sharing before deciding on a) which limit is useful and

}

// ResourceHandleMaxSize is the maximum size of allocation.resourceHandle.
const ResourceHandleMaxSize = 16 * 1024
```

Resource drivers can use the `ResourceHandle` to store some data directly or
cross-reference some other place where information is stored.
This data is guaranteed to be available when a Pod is about
to run on a node, in contrast to the ResourceClass which
may have been deleted in the meantime. It's also protected from
modification by a user, in contrast to an annotation.

// a Pod with ResourceClaims that use "WaitForFirstConsumer" allocation
// mode.
//
// This is an alpha type and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation
// feature gate.
type PodScheduling struct {
	metav1.TypeMeta

	// Status describes where resources for the Pod can be allocated.
	Status PodSchedulingStatus
}
```

PodScheduling objects get created by a scheduler when it processes
a pod which uses one or more unallocated ResourceClaims with delayed
allocation.

The name of a PodScheduling object must be the same as the corresponding Pod.
That Pod must be listed as owner in OwnerReferences
to ensure that the PodScheduling object gets deleted
when no longer needed. Normally the scheduler will delete it.

Drivers must ignore PodScheduling objects where the owning
pod already got deleted because such objects are orphaned
and will be removed soon.

```
// PodSchedulingSpec describes where resources for the Pod are needed.
type PodSchedulingSpec struct {
	// SelectedNode is the node for which allocation of ResourceClaims that
	// are referenced by the Pod and that use "WaitForFirstConsumer"
	// allocation is to be attempted.
	SelectedNode string

	// PotentialNodes lists nodes where the Pod might be able to run.
	//
	// The size of this field is limited to 128. This is large enough for
	// many clusters. Larger clusters may need more attempts to find a node
	// that suits all pending resources. This may get increased in the
	// future, but not reduced.
	// +optional
	PotentialNodes []string
}
```

When allocation is delayed, the scheduler must set
the `SelectedNode` for which it wants the resource(s) to be allocated
before the driver(s) start with allocation.
The scheduler also needs to decide on which node a Pod should run and will
ask the driver(s) on which nodes the resource might be
made available. To trigger that check, the scheduler
provides the names of nodes which might be suitable
for the Pod and will update that list periodically until
all resources are allocated.

The driver must ensure that the allocated resource
is available on this node or update ResourceSchedulingStatus.UnsuitableNodes
to indicate where allocation might succeed.

When allocation succeeds, drivers should immediately add
the pod to the ResourceClaimStatus.ReservedFor field
together with setting ResourceClaimStatus.Allocated. This
optimization may save scheduling attempts and roundtrips
through the API server because the scheduler does not
need to reserve the claim for the pod itself.

The selected node may change over time, for example
when the initial choice turns out to be unsuitable
after all. Drivers must not reallocate for a different
node when they see such a change because it would
lead to race conditions. Instead, the scheduler
will trigger deallocation of specific claims as
needed through the ResourceClaimStatus.DeallocationRequested
field.

The ResourceClass.SuiteableNodes node selector can be
used to filter out nodes based on labels. This prevents
adding nodes here that the driver then would need to
reject through UnsuitableNodes.

```
// PodSchedulingStatus describes where resources for the Pod can be allocated.
type PodSchedulingStatus struct {
	// ResourceClaims describes resource availability for each
	// pod.spec.resourceClaim entry where the corresponding ResourceClaim
	// uses "WaitForFirstConsumer" allocation mode.
	// +optional
	ResourceClaims []ResourceClaimSchedulingStatus

	// If there ever is a need to support other kinds of resources
	// than ResourceClaim, then new fields could get added here
	// for those other resources.
}
```

Each resource driver is responsible for providing information about
those resources in the Pod that the driver manages. It can skip
adding this information once it has allocated the resource.

A driver must add entries here for all its pending claims, even if
the ResourceSchedulingStatus.UnsuitabeNodes field is empty,
because the scheduler may decide to wait with selecting
a node until it has information from all drivers.

```
// ResourceClaimSchedulingStatus contains information about one particular
// ResourceClaim with "WaitForFirstConsumer" allocation mode.
type ResourceClaimSchedulingStatus struct {
	// Name matches the pod.spec.resourceClaims[*].Name field.
	Name string

	// UnsuitableNodes lists nodes that the ResourceClaim cannot be
	// allocated for.
	//
	// The size of this field is limited to 128, the same as for
	// PodSchedulingSpec.PotentialNodes. This may get increased in the
	// future, but not reduced.
	// +optional
	UnsuitableNodes []string
}

// PodSchedulingNodeListMaxSize defines the maximum number of entries in the
// node lists that are stored in PodScheduling objects. This limit is part
// of the API.
const PodSchedulingNodeListMaxSize = 256
```

UnsuitableNodes lists nodes that the claim cannot be allocated for.
Nodes listed here will be ignored by the scheduler when selecting a
node for a Pod. All other nodes are potential candidates, either
because no information is available yet or because allocation might
succeed.

A change to the PodSchedulingSpec.PotentialNodes field and/or a failed
allocation attempt triggers an update of this field: the driver
then checks all nodes listed in PotentialNodes and UnsuitableNodes
and updates UnsuitableNodes.

It must include the prior UnsuitableNodes in this check because the
scheduler will not list those again in PotentialNodes but they might
still be unsuitable.

This can change, so the driver must also refresh this information
periodically and/or after changing resource allocation for some
other ResourceClaim until a node gets selected by the scheduler.

// ResourceClaimConsumerReference contains enough information to let you

type ResourceClaimConsumerReference struct {

	// empty for the core API. This matches the group in the APIVersion
	// that is used when creating the resources.
	// +optional
	APIGroup string
	// Resource is the type of resource being referenced, for example "pods".
	Resource string
	// Name is the name of resource being referenced.
	Name string
	// UID identifies exactly one incarnation of the resource.
	UID types.UID
}
```

`ResourceClassParametersReference` and `ResourceClaimParametersReference` use
the more user-friendly "kind" to identify the object type because those
references are provided by users. `ResourceClaimConsumerReference` is typically
set by the control plane and therefore uses the more technically correct
"resource" name.

`Claims` is a list of structs with a single `Name` element because that struct

resource is made available to a container. This wouldn't be possible if
it was a list of strings.

### kube-controller-manager

The code that creates a ResourceClaim from a ResourceClaimTemplate will
be an almost verbatim copy of the [generic ephemeral volume
code](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/controller/volume/ephemeral),
just with different types.

kube-controller-manager will need new [RBAC
permissions](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/ff3e5e06a79bc69ad3d7ccedd277542b6712514b#diff-2ad93af2302076e0bdb5c7a4ebe68dd3188eee8959c72832181a7597417cd196) that allow creating and updating ResourceClaims.

kube-controller-manager also removes `claim.status.reservedFor` entries that reference
deleted objects or pods that have completed ("Phase" is "done").
This is required for pods because kubelet does not have write
permission for ResourceClaimStatus. Pods as user is the common case, so special
code based on a shared pod informer will handle it. All other user types can
be handled through a generic informer or simply polling.

In addition to updating `claim.status.reservedFor`, kube-controller-manager also deletes
ResourceClaims that are owned by a completed pod to ensure that they
get deallocated as soon as possible once they are not needed anymore.

### kube-scheduler

The scheduler plugin for ResourceClaims ("claim plugin" in this section)
needs to implement several extension points. It handles
communication with a resource driver through the apiserver. The [volume
binder
plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/scheduler/framework/plugins/volumebinding)
can serve as a reference.

Scheduling of a pod using a ResourceClaim may have to wait for a resource
driver to do something, typically allocating the resource. When the scheduler
notices this, the current scheduling attempt for the pod must stop and the pod
needs to be put back into the work queue. It then gets retried whenever a
ResourceClaim gets added or modified.

The following extension points are implemented in the new claim plugin:

#### Pre-filter

This checks whether a Pod uses any ResourceClaims. If there are ResourceClaims
with immediate binding that are not allocated yet, then the Pod will be marked
as unschedulable at the moment.

#### Filter

This checks whether the given node has access to those ResourceClaims which
were already allocated.

For unallocated ResourceClaims with delayed allocation, only those nodes are
filtered out that are explicitly listed in their UnsuitableNodes field of their
PodScheduling.Claims entry (if such an entry already exists) or that don't match
the optional ResourceClass.SuitableNodes node selector.

There are several
reasons why such a deny list is more suitable than an allow list:
- Nodes for which no information is available must pass the filter phase to be
  included in the list that will be passed to pre-score and to get copied
  into the PodScheduling.PotentialNodes field there.
- A node can already be chosen while there is no information yet and, if
  allocation for that node actually works, the Pod can get scheduled sooner.
- Some resource drivers might not have any unsuitable nodes, for example
  because they modify containers and that works on all nodes at all
  times. Forcing such drivers to set an allow list would cause unnecessary
  work.

In its state for the Pod the claim plugin must remember when it rejected a
node because of UnsuitableNodes. That information will be used in Post-filter
to deallocate resources.

#### Post-filter

This is called when no suitable node could be found. If the Pod depends on ResourceClaims with delayed
allocation, then deallocating one or more of these ResourceClaims may make the
Pod schedulable after allocating the resource elsewhere. Therefore each
ResourceClaim with delayed allocation is checked whether all of the following
conditions apply:
- allocated
- not currently in use
- it was the reason why some node could not fit the Pod, as recorded earlier in
  Filter

One of the ResourceClaims satisfying these criteria is picked randomly and deallocation
is requested by setting the ResourceClaimStatus.DeallocationRequested field. The scheduler then needs to wait
for the resource driver to react to that change and deallocate the resource.

This may make it possible to run the Pod
elsewhere. If it still doesn't help, deallocation may continue with another
ResourceClaim, if there is one. To prevent deallocating all resources merely
because the scheduler happens to check quickly, the next deallocation will only
requested when there is none currently pending.

At the moment, the claim plugin has no information that might enable it to
prioritize which resource to deallocate first. Future extensions of this KEP
might attempt to improve this.

#### Pre-score

This is passed a list of nodes that have passed filtering by the claim
plugin and the other plugins. That list is stored by the claim plugin and will
be copied to PodSchedulingSpec.PotentialNodes when the claim plugin creates or updates
the object in Reserve.

Pre-score is not called when there is only a single potential node. In that
case Reserve will store the selected node in PodSchedulingSpec.PotentialNodes.

#### Reserve

A node has been chosen for the Pod.

If using delayed allocation and one or more claims have not been allocated yet,
the claim plugin now needs to decide whether it wants to trigger allocation by
setting the PodSchedulingSpec.SelectedNode field. For a single unallocated
claim that is safe even if no information about unsuitable nodes is available
because the allocation will either succeed or fail. For multiple such claims
allocation only gets triggered when that information is available, to minimize
the risk of getting only some but not all claims allocated.  In both cases the
PodScheduling object gets created or updated as needed. This is also where the
PodSchedulingSpec.PotentialNodes field gets set.

If all resources have been allocated already,
the claim plugin ensures that the Pod is listed in the `claim.status.reservedFor` field
of its ResourceClaims. The driver can and should already have added
the Pod when specifically allocating the claim for it, so it may
be possible to skip this update.

If some resources are not allocated yet or reserving an allocated resource
fails, the scheduling attempt needs to be aborted and retried at a later time
or when the statuses change.

#### Unreserve

The claim plugin removes the Pod from the `claim.status.reservedFor` field
because it cannot be scheduled after all.

This is necessary to prevent a deadlock: suppose there are two stand-alone
claims that only can be used by one pod at a time and two pods which both
reference them. Both pods will get scheduled independently, perhaps even by
different schedulers. When each pod manages to allocate and reserve one claim,
then neither of them can get scheduled because they cannot reserve the other
claim.

Giving up the reservations in Unreserve means that the next pod scheduling
attempts have a chance to succeed. It's non-deterministic which pod will win,
but eventually one of them will. Not giving up the reservations would lead to a
permanent deadlock that somehow would have to be detected and resolved to make
progress.

### Cluster Autoscaler

When [Cluster
Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler#cluster-autoscaler)
encounters a pod that uses a resource claim, the autoscaler needs assistance by
the resource driver for that claim to make the right decisions. Without that
assistance, the autoscaler might scale up the wrong node group (resource is
provided by nodes in another group) or scale up unnecessarily (resource is
network-attached and adding nodes won't help).

At the start of a scale up or scale down cycle, autoscaler takes a snapshot of
the current cluster state. Then autoscaler determines whether a real or
fictional node fits a pod by calling the pre-filter and filter extension points
of scheduler plugins. If a pod fits a node, the snapshot is updated by calling
[NodeInfo.AddPod](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/7e3c98fd303359cb9f79dfc691da733a6ca2a6e3/pkg/scheduler/framework/types.go#L620-L623). This
influences further checks for other pending pods.

To support the custom allocation logic that a vendor uses for its resources,
the autoscaler needs an extension mechanism similar to the [scheduler
extender](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/7e3c98fd303359cb9f79dfc691da733a6ca2a6e3/pkg/scheduler/framework/extender.go#L24-L72). The
existing scheduler extender API has to be extended to include methods that
would only get called by the autoscaler, like starting a cycle. Instead of
adding these methods to the scheduler framework, autoscaler can define its own
interface that inherits from the framework:

```
import "k8s.io/pkg/scheduler/framework"

type Extender interface {
    framework.Extender

    // NodeSelected gets called when the autoscaler determined that
    // a pod should run on a node.
    NodeSelected(pod *v1.Pod, node *v1.Node) error

    // NodeReady gets called by the autoscaler to check whether
    // a new node is fully initialized.
    NodeReady(nodeName string) (bool, error)
}
```

The underlying implementation can either be compiled into a custom autoscaler
binary by cloud provider who controls the entire cluster or use HTTP similar to
the [HTTP
extender](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/7e3c98fd303359cb9f79dfc691da733a6ca2a6e3/pkg/scheduler/extender.go#L41-L53).
As an initial step, configuring such HTTP webhooks for different resource
drivers can be added to the configuration file defined by the `--cloud-config`
configuration file with a common field that gets added in all cloud provider
configs or a new `--config` parameter can be added. Later, dynamically
discovering deployed webhooks can be added through an autoscaler CRD.

In contrast to the in-tree HTTP extender implementation, the one for autoscaler
must be session oriented: when creating the extender for a cycle, a new "start"
verb needs to be invoked. When this is called in a resource driver controller
webhook, it needs to take a snapshot of the relevant state and return a session
ID. This session ID must be included in all following HTTP invocations as a
"session" header. Ensuring that a "stop" verb gets called reliably would
complicate the autoscaler. Instead, the webhook should support a small number
of recent session and garbage-collect older ones.

The existing `extenderv1.ExtenderArgs` and `extenderv1.ExtenderFilterResult`
API can be used for the "filter" operation. The extender can be added to the
list of active scheduler plugins because it implements the plugin interface.
Because filter operations may involve fictional nodes, the full `Node` objects
instead of just the node names must be passed. For fictional nodes, the
resource driver must determine based on labels which resources it can provide
on such a node. New APIs are needed for `NodeSelected` and `NodeReady`.

`NodeReady` is needed to solve one particular problem: when a new node first
starts up, it may be ready to run pods, but the pod from a resource driver's
DaemonSet may still be starting up. If the resource driver controller needs
information from such a pod, then it will not be able to filter
correctly. Similar to how extended resources are handled, the autoscaler then
first needs to wait until the extender also considers the node to be ready.

Such extenders completely replace the generic scheduler resource plugin. The
generic plugin would be able to filter out nodes based on already allocated
resources. But because it is stateless, it would not handle the use count
restrictions correctly when multiple pods are pending and reference the same
resource.

### kubelet

#### Managing resources

kubelet must ensure that resources are ready for use on the node before running
the first Pod that uses a specific resource instance and make the resource
available elsewhere again when the last Pod has terminated that uses it. For
both operations, kubelet calls a resource kubelet plugin as explained in the next
section.

Pods that are not listed in ReservedFor or where the ResourceClaim doesn't
exist at all must not be allowed to run. Instead, a suitable event must be
emitted which explains the problem. Such a situation can occur as part of
downgrade scenarios.

If this was the last Pod on the node that uses the specific
resource instance, then NodeUnprepareResource (see below) must have been called
successfully before allowing the pod to be deleted. This ensures that network-attached resource are available again
for other Pods, including those that might get scheduled to other nodes. It
also signals that it is safe to deallocate and delete the ResourceClaim.


![kubelet](./kubelet.png)

#### Communication between kubelet and resource kubelet plugin

Resource kubelet plugins are discovered through the [kubelet plugin registration
mechanism](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/device-plugins/#device-plugin-registration). A
new "ResourcePlugin" type will be used in the Type field of the
[PluginInfo](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/kubelet/pkg/apis/pluginregistration/v1#PluginInfo)
response to distinguish the plugin from device and CSI plugins.

Under the advertised Unix Domain socket the kubelet plugin provides the following
gRPC interface. It was inspired by
[CSI](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md),
with “volume” replaced by “resource” and volume specific parts removed.

##### `NodePrepareResource`

This RPC is called by kubelet when a Pod that wants to use the
specified resource is scheduled on a node.  The Plugin SHALL assume
that this RPC will be executed on the node where the resource will be
used.  ResourceClaim.meta.Namespace, ResourceClaim.meta.UID,
ResourceClaim.Name, ResourceClaim.meta.Namespace and
ResourceClaimStatus.AllocationResult should be passed to the Plugin
as parameters to identify the claim and perform resource preparation.

ResourceClaim parameters(namespace, UUID, name) are useful for debugging
and enable the resource driver to retrieve the full ResourceClaim object,
should that ever be needed (normally it shouldn't).

The Plugin SHALL return fully qualified device name[s].

The Plugin SHALL ensure that there are json file[s] in CDI format
for the allocated resource. These files SHALL be used by runtime to
update runtime configuration before creating containers that use the
resource.

This operation SHALL do as little work as possible as it’s called
after a pod is scheduled to a node. All potentially failing operations
SHALL be done during allocation phase.

This operation MUST be idempotent. If the resource corresponding to
the `resource_id` has already been prepared, the Plugin MUST reply `0
OK`.

If this RPC failed, or kubelet does not know if it failed or not, it
MAY choose to call `NodePrepareResource` again, or choose to call
`NodeUnprepareResource`.

On a successful call this RPC should return set of fully qualified
CDI device names, which kubelet MUST pass to the runtime through the CRI
protocol.

```protobuf
message NodePrepareResourceRequest {
  // The ResourceClaim namespace (ResourceClaim.meta.Namespace).
  // This field is REQUIRED.
  string namespace = 1;
  // The UID of the Resource claim (ResourceClaim.meta.UUID).
  // This field is REQUIRED.
  string claim_uid = 2;
  // The name of the Resource claim (ResourceClaim.meta.Name)
  // This field is REQUIRED.
  string claim_name = 3;
  // Data provided by the resource driver controller during allocation (AllocationResult.ResourceHandle)
  // This field is REQUIRED.
  string resource_handle = 4;
}

message NodePrepareResourceResponse {
  // These are the additional devices that kubelet must
  // make available via the container runtime. A resource
  // may have zero or more devices.
  repeated string cdi_device = 1;
}
```

CRI protocol MUST be extended for this purpose:

 * CDIDevice structure should be added to the CRI specification
```protobuf
// CDIDevice specifies a CDI device information.
message CDIDevice {
    // Fully qualified CDI device name
    // for example: vendor.com/gpu=gpudevice1
    // see more details in the CDI specification:
    // https://github.com/container-orchestrated-devices/container-device-interface/blob/main/SPEC.md
    string name = 1;
}
```
 * CDI devices should be added to the ContainerConfig structure:
```protobuf
// ContainerConfig holds all the required and optional fields for creating a
// container.
message ContainerConfig {
    // Metadata of the container. This information will uniquely identify the
    // container, and the runtime should leverage this to ensure correct
    // operation. The runtime may also use this information to improve UX, such
    // as by constructing a readable name.
    ContainerMetadata metadata = 1 ;
    // Image to use.
    ImageSpec image = 2;
    // Command to execute (i.e., entrypoint for docker)
    repeated string command = 3;
...
    // CDI devices for the container.
    repeated CDIDevice cdi_devices = 17;
}
```

###### NodePrepareResource Errors

If the plugin is unable to complete the NodePrepareResource call
successfully, it MUST return a non-ok gRPC code in the gRPC status.
If the conditions defined below are encountered, the plugin MUST
return the specified gRPC error code.  Kubelet MUST implement the
specified error recovery behavior when it encounters the gRPC error
code.

| Condition | gRPC Code | Description | Recovery Behavior |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Resource does not exist | 5 NOT_FOUND | Indicates that a resource corresponding to the specified `resource_id` does not exist. | Caller MUST verify that the `resource_id` is correct and that the resource is accessible and has not been deleted before retrying with exponential back off. |
 

##### `NodeUnprepareResource`

A Kubelet Plugin MUST implement this RPC call. This RPC is a reverse
operation of `NodePrepareResource`. This RPC MUST undo the work by
the corresponding `NodePrepareResource`. This RPC SHALL be called by
kubelet at least once for each successful `NodePrepareResource`. The
Plugin SHALL assume that this RPC will be executed on the node where
the resource is being used.

This RPC is called by kubelet when the Pod using the resource is being
deleted.

This operation MUST be idempotent. If this RPC failed, or kubelet does
not know if it failed or not, it can choose to call
`NodeUnprepareResource` again.

```protobuf
message NodeUnprepareResourceRequest {
  // The ResourceClaim namespace (ResourceClaim.meta.Namespace).
  // This field is REQUIRED.
  string namespace = 1;
  // The UID of the Resource claim (ResourceClaim.meta.UUID).
  // This field is REQUIRED.
  string claim_uid = 2;
  // The name of the Resource claim (ResourceClaim.meta.Name)
  // This field is REQUIRED.
  string claim_name = 3;
  // List of fully qualified CDI device names
  // Kubelet plugin returns them in the NodePrepareResourceResponse
  repeated string cdi_device = 4;
}

message NodeUnprepareResourceResponse {
  // Intentionally empty.
}
```

###### NodeUnprepareResource Errors

If the plugin is unable to complete the NodeUprepareResource call
successfully, it MUST return a non-ok gRPC code in the gRPC status.
If the conditions defined below are encountered, the plugin MUST
return the specified gRPC error code.  Kubelet MUST implement the
specified error recovery behavior when it encounters the gRPC error
code.

| Condition | gRPC Code | Description | Recovery Behavior |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Resource does not exist | 5 NOT_FOUND | Indicates that a resource corresponding to the specified `resource_id` does not exist. | Caller MUST verify that the `resource_id` is correct and that the resource is accessible and has not been deleted before retrying with exponential back off. |

#### Implementing optional resources

This can be handled entirely by a resource driver: its parameters can support a
range starting at zero or a boolean flag that indicates that something is not a
hard requirement. When asked to filter nodes for delayed allocation, the driver
reports nodes where the resource is available and only falls back to those
without it when resources are exhausted. When asked to allocate, it reserves
actual resources if possible, but also proceeds with marking the ResourceClaim
as allocated if that is not possible. Kubernetes then can schedule a pod using
the ResourceClaim. The pod needs to determine through information passed in by
the resource driver which resources are actually available to it.

#### Implementing a plugin for node resources

The proposal depends on a central resource driver controller. Implementing that
part poses an additional challenge for drivers that manage resources
locally on a node because they need to establish a secure
communication path between nodes and the central controller.

How drivers implement that is up to the developer. This section
outlines a possible solution. If there is sufficient demand, common
code for this solution could be made available as a reusable Go
module.

- Each driver defines a CRD which describes how much resources are
  available per node and how much is currently allocated.
- RBAC rules ensure that only the driver can modify objects of that
  type. The objects can and should be namespaced, which makes it
  possible to add automatic cleanup via owner references (similar to
  CSIStorageCapacity).
- The kubelet driver publishes information about the local state via a
  CRD object named after the node. Driver developers can document
  those CRDs and then users can query the cluster state by listing
  those objects.
- The driver controller watches those objects and ResourceClaims. It
  can keep track of claims that are in the process of being allocated
  and consider that when determining where another claim might get
  allocated. For delayed allocation, the driver controller informs the
  scheduler by updating the ResourceClaimStatus.UnsuitableNodes field.
  Eventually, the scheduler sets the selected node field. For immediate allocation,
  the driver controller itself sets the selected node field.
- In both cases, the kubelet plugin waits for a ResourceClaim assigned to
  its own node and tries to allocate the resource. If that fails, it
  can unset the selected node field to trigger another allocation
  attempt elsewhere.

-->

End-to-end testing depends on a working resource driver and a container runtime
with CDI support. A mock driver will be developed in parallel to developing the
code in Kubernetes, but as it will depend on the new APIs, we have to get those
merged first.

Such a mock driver could be as simple as taking parameters from ResourceClass
and ResourceClaim and turning them into environment variables that then get
checked inside containers. Tests for different behavior of an driver in various
scenarios can be simulated by running the control-plane part of it in the E2E
test itself. For interaction with kubelet, proxying of the gRPC interface can
be used, as in the
[csi-driver-host-path](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-host-path/blob/16251932ab81ad94c9ec585867104400bf4f02e5/cmd/hostpathplugin/main.go#L61-L63):
then the kubelet plugin runs on the node(s), but the actual processing of gRPC
calls happens inside the E2E test.

All tests that don't involve actually running a Pod can become part of
conformance testing. Those tests that run Pods cannot be because CDI support in
runtimes is not required.

Once we have end-to-end tests, at least two Prow jobs will be defined:
- A pre-merge job that will be required and run only for the in-tree code of
  this KEP (`optional: false`, `run_if_changed` set, `always_run: false`).
- A periodic job that runs the same tests to determine stability and detect
  unexpected regressions.

For beta:

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

The usual Kubernetes upgrade and downgrade strategy applies for in-tree
components. Vendors must take care that upgrades and downgrades work with the
drivers that they provide to customers.

### Version Skew Strategy

There may be situations where dynamic resource allocation is enabled in some
parts of the cluster (apiserver, kube-scheduler), but not on some nodes. The
resource driver is responsible for setting ResourceClaim.AvailableOnNodes so
that those nodes are not included.

But if a Pod with ResourceClaims already got scheduled onto a node without the
feature enabled, kubelet will start it without those additional
resources. Applications must be prepared for this and refuse to run. This will
put the Pod into a failed state that administrators or users need to resolve by
deleting the Pod.

The same applies when the entire cluster gets downgraded to a version where
dynamic resource allocation is unsupported or the feature gets disabled via
feature gates: existing Pods with ResoureClaims will be scheduled as if those
resources were not requested.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [X] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: DynamicResourceAllocation
  - Components depending on the feature gate:
    - kube-apiserver
    - kube-controller-manager
    - kube-scheduler
    - kubelet

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes. Applications that were already deployed and are running will continue to
work, but they will stop working when containers get restarted because those
restarted containers won't have the additional resources.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

Pods might have been scheduled without handling resources. Those Pods must be
deleted to ensure that the re-created Pods will get scheduled properly.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

Tests for apiserver will cover disabling the feature. This primarily matters
for the extended PodSpec: the new fields must be preserved during updates even
when the feature is disabled.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

###### How can a rollout fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

Workloads not using ResourceClaims should not be impacted because the new code
will not do anything besides checking the Pod for ResourceClaims.

When kube-controller-manager fails to create ResourceClaims from
ResourceClaimTemplates, those Pods will not get scheduled. Bugs in
kube-scheduler might lead to not scheduling Pods that could run or worse,
schedule Pods that should not run. Those then will get stuck on a node where
kubelet will refuse to start them. None of these scenarios affect already
running workloads.

Failures in kubelet might affect running workloads, but only if containers for
those workloads need to be restarted.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?


One indicator are unexpected restarts of the cluster control plane
components. Another are an increase in the number of pods that fail to
start. In both cases further analysis of logs and pod events is needed to
determine whether errors are related to this feature.

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

This will be done manually before transition to beta by bringing up a KinD
cluster with kubeadm and changing the feature gate for individual components.

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

No.

### Monitoring Requirements

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

There will be pods which have a non-empty PodSpec.ResourceClaims field and ResourceClaim objects.

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

For kube-controller-manager, metrics similar to the generic ephemeral volume
controller will be added:

- [X] Metrics
  - Metric name: `resource_controller_create_total`
  - Metric name: `resource_controller_create_failures_total`
  - Metric name: `workqueue` with `name="resource_claim"`

For kube-scheduler and kubelet, the existing metrics for handling Pods will be
used.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the above SLIs?

For Pods not using ResourceClaims, the same SLOs apply as before.

For kube-controller-manager, metrics for the new controller could be checked to
ensure that work items do not remain in the queue for too long, for some
definition of "too long".

Pod scheduling and startup are more important. However, expected performance
will depend on how resources are used (for example, how often new Pods are
created), therefore it is impossible to predict what reasonable SLOs might be.

The resource manager component will do its work similarly to the 
existing volume manager, but the overhead and complexity should
be lower:

* Resource preparation should be fairly quick as in most cases it simply
  creates CDI file 1-3 Kb in size. Unpreparing resource usually means
  deleting CDI file, so it should be quick as well.

* The complexity is lower than in the volume manager
  because there is only one global operation needed (prepare vs. 
  attach + publish for each pod).
  
* Reconstruction after a kubelet restart is simpler (call 
  NodePrepareResource again vs. trying to determine whether 
  volumes are mounted).

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

No.

### Dependencies

The container runtime must support CDI.

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

A third-party resource driver is required for allocating resources.

### Scalability

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

For Pods not using ResourceClaims, not much changes. kube-controller-manager,
kube-scheduler and kubelet will have additional watches for ResourceClaim and
ResourceClass, but if the feature isn't used, those watches
will not cause much overhead.

If the feature is used, ResourceClaim will be modified during Pod scheduling,
startup and teardown by kube-scheduler, the third-party resource driver and
kubelet. Once a ResourceClaim is allocated and the Pod runs, there will be no
periodic API calls. How much this impacts performance of the apiserver
therefore mostly depends on how often this feature is used for new
ResourceClaims and Pods. Because it is meant for long-running applications, the
impact should not be too high.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

For ResourceClass, only a few (something like 10 to 20)
objects per cluster are expected. Admins need to create those.

The number of ResourceClaim objects depends on how much the feature is
used. They are namespaced and get created directly or indirectly by users. In
the most extreme case, there will be one or more ResourceClaim for each Pod.
But that seems unlikely for the intended use cases.

Kubernetes itself will not impose specific limitations for the number of these
objects.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

Only if the third-party resource driver uses features of the cloud provider.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

The PodSpec potentially changes and thus all objects where it is embedded as
template. Merely enabling the feature does not change the size, only using it
does.

In the simple case, a Pod references existing ResourceClaims by name, which
will add some short strings to the PodSpec and to the ContainerSpec. Embedding
a ResourceClaimTemplate will increase the size more, but that will depend on
the number of custom parameters supported by a resource driver and thus is hard to
predict.

The ResourceClaim objects will initially be fairly small. However, if delayed
allocation is used, then the list of node names or NodeSelector instances
inside it might become rather large and in the worst case will scale with the
number of nodes in the cluster.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

Startup latency of schedulable stateless pods may be affected by enabling the
feature because some CPU cycles are needed for each Pod to determine whether it
uses ResourceClaims.

Actively using the feature will increase load on the apiserver, so latency of
API calls may get affected.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

Merely enabling the feature is not expected to increase resource usage much.

How much using it will increase resource usage depends on the usage patterns
and is hard to predict.

### Troubleshooting

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

The Kubernetes control plane will be down, so no new Pods get
scheduled. kubelet may still be able to start or or restart containers if it
already received all the relevant updates (Pod, ResourceClaim, etc.).

###### What are other known failure modes?

To be added for beta.

## Alternatives

### ResourceClaimTemplate

Instead of creating a ResourceClaim from a template, the
PodStatus could be extended to hold the same information as a
ResourceClaimStatus. Every component which works with that information
then needs permission and extra code to work with PodStatus. Creating
an extra object seems simpler.

### Reusing volume support as-is

ResourceClaims are similar to PersistentVolumeClaims and also a lot of
the associated logic is similar. An [early
prototype](https://github.com/intel/proof-of-concept-cdi) used a
custom CSI driver to manage resources.

The user experience with that approach is poor because per-resource
parameters must be stored in annotations of a PVC due to the lack of
custom per-PVC parameters. Passing annotations as additional parameters was [proposed
before](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-provisioner/issues/86)
but were essentially [rejected by
SIG-Storage](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-provisioner/issues/86#issuecomment-465836185)
because allowing apps to set custom parameters would make apps
non-portable.

The current volume support also has open issues that affect the
“volume as resource” approach: Multiple different Pods on a node are
allowed to use the same
volume. https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2489 will
address that, but is still work in progress.  Recovery from a bad node
selection during delayed binding may get stuck when a Pod has multiple
volumes because volumes are not getting deleted after a partial
provisioning. A proposal to fix that needs further work
(https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1703).  Each “fake”
CSI driver would have to implement and install a scheduler extender
because storage capacity tracking only considers volume size as
criteria for selecting nodes, which is not applicable for custom
resources.

### Extend volume support

The StorageClass and PersistentVolumeClaim structs could be extended
to allow custom parameters. Together with an extension of the CSI
standard that would address the main objection against the previous
alternative.

However, SIG-Storage and the CSI community would have to agree to this
kind of reuse and accept that some of the code maintained by them
becomes more complex because of these new use cases.

### Extend Device Plugins

The device plugins API could be extended to implement some of the
requirements mentioned in the “Motivation” section of this
document. There were certain attempts to do it, for example an attempt
to [add ‘Deallocate’ API call](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1949) and [pass pod annotations to 'Allocate' API call](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61775)

However, most of the requirements couldn’t be satisfied using this
approach as they would require major incompatible changes in the
Device Plugins API. For example: partial and optional resource
allocation couldn’t be done without changing the way resources are
currently declared on the Pod and Device Plugin level.

Extending the device plugins API to use [Container Device Interface](https://github.com/container-orchestrated-devices/container-device-interface)
would help address some of the requirements, but not all of them.

NodePrepareResource and NodeUnprepareResource could be added to the Device Plugins API and only get called for
resource claims.

However, this would mean that
developers of the device plugins would have to implement mandatory
API calls (ListAndWatch, Allocate), which could create confusion
as those calls are meaningless for the Dynamic Resource Allocation
purposes.

Even worse, existing device plugins would have to implement the new
calls with stubs that return errors because the generated Go interface
will require them.

It should be also taken into account that device plugins API is
beta. Introducing incompatible changes to it may not be accepted by
the Kubernetes community.

### Webhooks instead of ResourceClaim updates

In the current design, scheduler and the third-party resource driver communicate by
updating fields in a ResourceClaim. This has several advantages compared to an
approach were kube-scheduler retrieves information from the resource driver
via HTTP:
* No need for a new webhook API.
* Simpler deployment of a resource driver because all it needs are
  credentials to communicate with the apiserver.
* Current status can be checked by querying the ResourceClaim.

The downside is higher load on the apiserver and an increase of the size of
ResourceClaim objects.

### ResourceDriver

Similar to CSIDriver for storage, a separate object describing a resource
driver might be useful at some point. At the moment it is not needed yet and
therefore not part of the v1alpha1 API. If it becomes necessary to describe
optional features of a resource driver, such a ResourceDriver type might look
like this:

```
type ResourceDriver struct {
    // The name of the object is the unique driver name.
    ObjectMeta

    // Features contains a list of features supported by the driver.
    // New features may be added over time and must be ignored
    // by code that does not know about them.
    Features []ResourceDriverFeature
}

type ResourceDriverFeature struct {
    // Name is one of the pre-defined names for a feature.
    Name ResourceDriverFeatureName
    // Parameters might provide additional information about how
    // the driver supports the feature. Boolean features have
    // no parameters, merely listing them indicates support.
    Parameters runtime.RawExtension
}
```


## Infrastructure Needed

Initially, all development will happen inside the main Kubernetes
repository. The mock driver can be developed inside test/e2e/dra.  For the
generic part of that driver, i.e. the code that other drivers can reuse, and
other common code a new staging repo `k8s.io/dynamic-resource-allocation` is
needed.
